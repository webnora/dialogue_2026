"(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement . No injuries were reported. ""It was a miracle that no one was injured,"" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. ""We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,"" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005. But before South Sudan gained independence in July of last year, human rights monitors expressed concerns that longstanding grievances could again lead to violence consuming the region. In November, there were several days of bombings near an entry point for refugees at the border, the United Nations reported. It did not specify who launched the bombs."
"He flies the world in a blood-red private jet, has an access-all-areas Formula 1 pass worth a cool £1 million and is fresh from the red carpet at the BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards, resplendent in a solid gold chain worthy of a superstar rapper. And like most A-listers, this particular star is not without a few unpleasant habits. Support staff at the BBC awards can attest as much, having been tasked with picking up after him. Welcome to the world of Roscoe Hamilton, a two-year-old bulldog who lives a life of absurd luxury. Scroll down for video . Roscoe (centre) lounges about while on holiday with Lewis Hamilton and his other dog, bulldog bitch Coco . As the adored pet of Lewis Hamilton, reigning Formula 1 world champion, his is an existence of five-star pampering. Home is a £10 million apartment in Monaco, which he shares with Hamilton, his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger and a bulldog bitch called Coco. Yet there is no question who rules the roost. Since padding into Lewis’s life in February 2013, Roscoe has taken centre stage. Take the family’s sleeping arrangements. Hamilton may be dating one of the most desired women on the planet in Nicole, but when the day ends, it is Roscoe who snuggles between the Egyptian cotton sheets alongside his master. (Ms Scherzinger is based for much of the year in America.) And as the racing driver jets between the U.S. and Europe in that gleaming £20 million Bombardier CL-600, he does so with Roscoe sitting beside him on his personal cream leather seat. Double act: The pair together at last night's BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards . Indeed, Roscoe has his own passport as well as that pass to the Formula 1 paddock, which was given to him by Bernie Ecclestone, the billionaire overlord of the sport. Sponsors pay upwards of £1 million for these passes, yet Roscoe’s, which features a photograph of the bulldog in a pair of expensive Beats headphones, was a gift. While many people were nonplussed to see a celebrity turning up to the televised awards with his pet, to those who know Hamilton well it was no surprise to see the pooch waddling along the red carpet on Sunday night, complete with gold chain. Hamilton was wearing this jewellery at some of his public appearances towards the end of the Formula 1 season, and is happy to share his substantial worldly goods with his dog. This is a fastidious professional who obsesses over the tiniest detail to give him a racing advantage. Yet he allows Roscoe to play with his race helmet as if it was a toy ball. And this is no ordinary piece of kit. It takes three days to make one and they cost £3,300 apiece. That said, they are designed to withstand 800c flames and huge impacts, so an encounter with an enthusiastic bulldog is unlikely to cause too much of a problem. The helmet is adorned with an image of Hamilton with Nicole and — you guessed it — Roscoe. The extent of the driver’s canine infatuation has ruffled feathers, however, with questions raised about whether it is appropriate to allow a dog into the racing paddock. Legendary commentator Murray Walker did not mince his words: ‘I have the utmost respect and admiration for Lewis, but the F1 paddock is no place for a dog. Think of the safety reasons. Think, too, of how a dog’s hearing system is infinitely more sensitive than a human’s — and my hearing has been destroyed by F1 cars. I am utterly amazed he’s allowed to take the dog in. I can’t imagine what the hell they are thinking about. It’s madness.’ All of which presented a dilemma for Hamilton’s racing team, Mercedes. By that point, Roscoe had his own bespoke canine racing suit, while Lewis spent £220,000 on hiring a luxury motor home for the European season — because the hotels frequented by the Formula 1 hierarchy do not allow dogs. Some race tracks, seduced by the glamour of the driver and his designer dog, use them as an advertising tool. For the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap. Roscoe, however, does not sleep in a kennel. And when his master is otherwise disposed, only the very best treatment will do. The X Factor: A friendly nuzzle for Lewis's girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. The singer spends half the year in America - leaving a space in the couple's bed for Roscoe to slip between the Egyptian cotton sheets . High flyers: UK-bound with Roscoe (left), Coco (centre) and Lewis Hamilton on board a private jet . Marie-Pierre Hansom, senior ‘host’ at Mercedes-Benz World in Surrey — the carmaker’s flagship centre — was left in no doubt about this earlier this year. Accustomed to dealing with the biggest star names, she was taken aback by what happened when the driver arrived to film a commercial. With Lewis fed, watered, made up and safely installed on set, she was settling down for a cup of coffee when the phone rang. ‘It was our reception desk advising me that two of his guests had arrived on site,’ she says. ‘Most of the entourage were here by then, so I thought: “Who could it be?” What's up, dawg: In Beats headphones. The two-year-old bulldog even has his own pass to the Formula 1 paddock . ‘I went to introduce myself and I’m faced with two little bulldogs. Panic inside, we don’t allow dogs in the building, what am I going to do? I need to move them pretty quickly. ‘I make it to the suite, get them set up very quickly. They need water, they need food, they need cushions. They had to be taken for various things such as comfort breaks. We even had to call the cleaning team for help at one point, because I don’t deal with things like that. I started the day expecting one celebrity. I finished it with three. ‘I hope I made them happy, and by the snores coming out of Roscoe I think they all had a good time.’ Since arriving in Hamilton’s life, Roscoe has become a social media star. There is footage of him in Lewis’s bed, on aircraft and even on a trip to a bowling alley. Hamilton, who doesn’t have children, is fond of dressing up his beloved dog in designer hats, headphones and jewellery. He also brings along Roscoe to interviews (on one occasion having to apologise when the mutt’s loud snoring drowned out his answers). Yet it’s plain Roscoe has fulfilled an important role in his master’s life. Raised in the rarefied atmosphere of motor racing, anointed as the chosen one since his teens, it is hardly surprising Hamilton is not the most worldly of individuals. Blessed — or cursed — with a prickliness particular to the uber-competitive, he clearly takes great comfort from the unquestioning adoration of his dogs. Roscoe was joined last year by the bulldog bitch Coco, yet she has been comparatively anonymous, due in part to health problems. She has had to undergo two tricky operations to treat a problem with her tongue, so by and large Roscoe has travelled with Lewis while she stayed at home. Lewis grew up with pet labradors, though, so why a bulldog? The answer may lie in his controversial relationship with his nationality. Playtime: Making friends with Lewis's nephew, Kalden, when Hamilton spent a day with his mother and sister . Roscoe  has his own passport and for the Silverstone Grand Prix, the organisers provided Roscoe with a bespoke timber kennel, with his name over the door and a personalised cap . In his acceptance speech after winning Sports Personality of the Year on Sunday night, much was made of his pride in his British heritage. Yet this is a man who, the moment the big bucks started rolling in, decamped to Switzerland and then Monaco as a tax exile. Twitter immediately lit up with outraged comments about the BBC’s sporting champion not even paying a licence fee. He may believe that by having a British bulldog by his side, the public will subconsciously associate him with all things patriotic. But perhaps not when the dog is Roscoe Hamilton, surely the most pampered ‘non-dom’ in the canine world. Chilling out: The intrepid trio take to the slopes. Roscoe was joined last year by the bulldog bitch Coco, yet she has been comparatively anonymous, due in part to health problems ."
"By . Daniel Martin . PUBLISHED: . 07:59 EST, 30 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:23 EST, 30 July 2013 . Controversy: Lord Howell of Guildford said fracking could go ahead in the North East because it was inhabitable . A Tory peer provoked a storm of criticism yesterday by suggesting fracking should be concentrated in the North East of England because it is ‘desolate’. Lord Howell, the father-in-law of Chancellor George Osborne, said ‘beautiful rural areas’ further south should be spared the disruption caused by the controversial method of shale gas extraction. The peer, who as David Howell was Energy Secretary under Margaret Thatcher and long-serving MP for Guildford in Surrey, claimed that the North East was so sparsely populated that fracking could take place without any impact on the environment or local people. His comments in the House of Lords drew gasps of astonishment – and immediate condemnation. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby tweeted: ‘North east England very beautiful, rugged, welcoming, inspiring, historic, advancing, not “desolate” as was said in House of Lords today.’ Labour accused Lord Howell, 77, whose daughter Frances is married to the Chancellor, of wishing to protect Tory heartlands in the South East while condemning the North to shale gas drilling. The peer later apologised for ‘any offence caused’ but his comments are embarrassing for the Conservatives, who must gain seats in the North to have any hope of winning the 2015 election. Last night Tories distanced themselves from Lord Howell, pointing out that he was no longer connected to the Government after stepping down in April as  William Hague’s adviser on energy. His intervention came as villagers entered the sixth day of protests against fracking in the West Sussex countryside. Some 23 people have so far been arrested in Balcombe, which has been earmarked for exploratory drilling by fracking company Cuadrilla. Stand-off: There is a heavy police presence today escorting vehicles past protestors at a proposed fracking site in Balcombe, West Sussex . Police lines: Officers have been forced to escort lorries on to the fracking site at Balcombe . Protest: Opponents of fracking claim it can trigger earthquakes and risks polluting waterways . Forcibly removed: Former Page 3 model Marina Pepper was carried away from the scene where protestors were blocking a lorry at a proposed fracking site near Balcombe, West Sussex . Police outnumbered the campaigners . yesterday morning, with officers forming a human shield to enable . delivery lorries to enter the site unhindered by a group of 50 . protesters who included Mick Jagger’s ex-wife Bianca Jagger. Fracking involves pumping liquid at high pressure deep underground to split shale rock and release gas for use as fuel. Lord Howell told the Lords that it . would be a ‘mistake to think of and discuss fracking in terms of the . whole of the United Kingdom in one go’. ‘There obviously are, in beautiful . rural areas, worries about not just the drilling and the fracking, which . I think are exaggerated, but about the trucks, and the delivery, and . the roads, and the disturbance,’ he said. ‘And those are quite justified . worries. ‘But there are large and uninhabited . and desolate areas. Certainly in part of the North East where there’s . plenty of room for fracking, well away from anybody’s residence, where . we could conduct without any kind of threat to the rural environment.’ Despite stunned exclamations from . peers, Lord Howell continued unperturbed, saying that a distinction . ‘should be made between one area and another, rather than lump them all . together’. Labour’s Lord Beecham, former leader . of Newcastle City Council, said: ‘Neville Chamberlain spoke of pre-war . Czechoslovakia as “a far away country of which we know nothing”. Lord . Howell clearly has a similar view on the North East and his comments . once again highlight the Tories’ problem with the North.’ While Northumberland is England’s . least densely populated county, the North East, far from being desolate, . contains a wealth of spectacular scenery including the north Pennines, . the Cheviots and a national park, as well as two World Heritage sites: . Hadrian’s Wall and Durham Cathedral. David Skelton, director of Renewal, . which campaigns to broaden the appeal of the Conservative Party, said: . ‘The North East boasts some of the finest landscapes in the country. I’d . be delighted to give Lord Howell a tour. ‘The choice over where fracking should take place should be taken by local communities.’ Jude Leitch, of Northumberland . Tourism, said: ‘He’s probably never been up here in his life.’ Last . night Lord Howell was forced into a humiliating climbdown. In a statement he said: ‘I apologise . for any offence caused. I certainly did not intend to suggest that the . North East is desolate. ‘There are parts of the country that . are less densely inhabited than others. That includes parts of the North . East but also other areas in the South of England as well.’ Lord Howell (pictured right) was born in 1936 and educated at Eton. From 1954 to 1956 he was in the Armed Forces in the 2nd Battalion Coldstream Guards. He studied Economics at King’s College, Cambridge, graduating in 1959. His first job was with HM Treasury from 1959-60 as part of the Treasury Economic Section. He then spent four years as a leader writer for the Daily Telegraph until 1964. Lord Howell has written a number of books, including The Edge of Now, about the challenges of democracy in the digital age, published in 2000. After an unsuccessful bid for Dudley at the 1964 General Election, he became director of the Conservative Political Centre. Two years later, he eventually won the seat of Guildford, representing the Surrey county town until 1997, when he was made a life peer. Lord Howell is the former Secretary of State for Energy, and later for Transport in Margaret Thatcher’s first Cabinet (1979-83). He was Minister of State in Northern Ireland (1972-74) and has held several other government posts. He was chairman of the International Energy Agency ministerial meeting in May 1979. From 1987-97, he was chairman of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee. From May 2010 to Sept 2012, Lord Howell was appointed Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, with responsibility for international energy policy. After stepping down from the post in September 2012, he was appointed as personal adviser to Foreign Secretary William Hague on energy and resource security. According to the Conservative Party website, Lord Howell is credited by several authorities with having invented the idea of privatisation in the late 1960s. He is also Chairman of the British Institute of Energy Economics, which counts Shell and BP among its members. Lord Howell is married with two daughters and one son. One of his daughters, Frances, is married to George Osborne, the Chancellor."
"When Amer Deghayes graduated from a college in Brighton with a qualification in business studies  this summer, he had his whole future ahead of him. Rather than start a career, he chose to follow in his father's footsteps and travel to Syria in order to had out aid to the needy. But once inside the country he quickly joined forces with the al-Nusra Front, and al-Queda linked group fighting against the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Amer Deghayes (centre, in grey) was the first of his family to leave for Syria, telling his parents he wanted to be an aid worker. Brother Abdullah (front left) and Jaffar (front right) followed soon after . Worse still, his brothers Abdullah, then 18 and due to start a University course in his home-town, and Jaffar, 17, followed after him. Their mother, Einas Abulsayen, said that the two younger boys left without warning, after the youngest tricked her into thinking he needed his passport for ID at school. She said just before leaving Jaffar asked her for a cuddle. She didn't realise she was holding her son for what could prove to be the last time. On the way to the airport, the boys met up with long-term family friend Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who had stolen his 15-year-old brother's passport before going to join them. Despite being unaccompanied by an adult, all three are believed to have caught a flight from Luton airport to Turkey, where they found their way into Syria. Abubaker Deghayes went to see his three sons several times in the next few months in several unsuccessful attempts to persuade them to come home. He insists that during this time he believed the boys were still working for aid charities, but in April, he came face to face with the truth. While Amer had once been an intelligent college student, earning a qualification in business studies, once in Syria he joined the al-Nusra Front, an al-Queda affiliated group fighting Bashar al-Assad . Amer's father travelled  to see his sons, who refused to come home and insisted they were working with aid charities. But in April he learned the truth when Amer called to say Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian sniper . His eldest son Amer, called to say his younger brother Abdullah had been killed by a Syrian army sniper in Kassab. Mr Deghayes said: 'Amer told me Abdullah advanced into territory of the Syrian army then a sniper shot him in the chest. He fell on the ground and looked at the sky and laughed. 'You feel he died a good death as a Muslim. As a martyr, he goes to paradise. But at the same time you feel sad for the loss.' Then, last week, Mrs Kamara also got a call from Amer. Over Skype he explained that Ibrahim had also been killed, this time by one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria after his compound was hit. The three brothers were joined by another Brighton student, Ibrahim Kamara, 19, who stole his 15-year-old brother's passport before flying from Luton airport to fight in Syria . His mother Kadiatu Kamara (pictured) also recieved a call from Amer last week to say her son had been killed in one of the first U.S. airstrikes in Syria, which hit a compound he was in . He explained that Ibrahim, who  was the going by the name of Khalil al-Britani, had recorded a message on his phone for his family in case he died, but the phone had been destroyed. With airstrikes intensifying, and fighting in Syria growing fiercer by the day, the Deghayes family fear they will never see their remaining two sons again. In part, they blame British authorities for telling teenage jihadis that they will face prosecution if they return to the UK. Mr Deghayes believes there should be an amnesty to allow his boys to come home. Both parents insist that their sons are not 'terrorists', merely selfless boys who travelled to Syria to 'help defend those who are weak.' Around 400 Britons are believed to have gone to Syria over the last two years, authorities believe, with an estimated 20 having died. The Deghayes' parents insist their boys are not terrorists, and simply went to Syria to protect the weak. They now fear they will never see their two remaining sons again . Those who have died include Abdul Waheed Majeed, 41, who is believed to have driven a lorry to a jail in Aleppo before detonating a bomb in February. The married father of three, who was born and raised in Crawley, West Sussex, left Britain in 2013, telling his family he was going on a humanitarian mission to Syria. Photographs were also published in January of two British brothers, named in reports as Akra and Mohamed Sebah from north London, who were believed to have died in battle in the war-torn country in September."
"By . Jaymi Mccann . A member of the notorious 'Pink Panther' jewel thief gang escaped from a Swiss prison after accomplices rammed a gate and overpowered guards with bursts from their AK-47s, police said Friday. Bosnian national Milan Poparic, 34, fled from the Orbe prison in the western canton of Vaud. He is the third member of the Pink Panthers to escape from a Swiss prison in as many months, according to Vaud police. Milan Poparic (left) was one of the Pink Panthers. he fled with Adrian Abrecht (right) from the Orbe prison . Poparic had robbed a jewellery store in Neuchatel, Switzerland (pictured) in 2009 . He escaped with with fellow inmate Adrian Albrecht, 52 on Thursday. Poparic had been serving a sentence of six years and eight months for robbing a jewellery store in the Swiss city of Neuchatel in 2009. Albrecht was serving a seven-year prison sentence for various crimes including robbery, arson and money laundering. Police said Poparic was part of the Pink Panthers network, prime suspects in a series of spectacular thefts. According to Interpol the group has targeted luxury watch and jewelry stores in Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the United States, netting over 330 million euros ($436 million) since 1999. The two accomplices rammed the compound with two vehicles, clearing away barbed wire for the escape, then fled with the two escapees in one vehicle and set fire to the other. Inspired: Interpol dubbed them the 'Pink Panther' gang, recalling the 1963 movie starring Peter Sellers as the bungling Inspector Clouseau . Teams of police and other authorities from Switzerland and France, some using police dogs, are searching for them. At . a news conference Friday, Beatrice Metraux, head of Vaud's interior . department that includes responsibility for prisons, said the guards . were unarmed but were backed up by officers from the Swiss private . security firm Protectas, who were equipped with 'simple handguns' that . were no match for the AK-47s. She said the escapees hadn't received any visits in recent months other than from their lawyers. 'This is an invasion, rather than an escape, orchestrated by a heavily armed organized gang,' she said, adding that the staff was shocked and one person was getting psychological counseling. Vaud police spokesman Jean-Christophe Sauterel said the vehicle remains missing, and it's not known which way they fled. It's still unclear, he added, whether the two accomplices are members of the Pink Panthers, although their actions suggest it. Interpol dubbed them the 'Pink Panther' gang, recalling the 1963 movie starring Peter Sellers as the bungling Inspector Clouseau, but it isn't known whether members themselves use that name. The gang is believed to have a core membership of about 40 people, many of them from the Balkans. Sauterel said there doesn't appear to be any danger to the public, since killing isn't part of the Pink Panthers' usual methods. But, he added, the police are 'dealing with people who were involved in the armed forces during the war in former Yugoslavia.' In mid-May, two members of the Pink Panthers - a 45-year-old Serb, who was being temporarily detained for aggravated robbery, and a 47-year-old Frenchman held for aggravated robbery and drug and weapons violations - escaped from the Bois-Mermet prison along with three others, helped by accomplices, the police said."

The new $6.4billion eastern span of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge has been opened to traffic after years of delays and cost overruns, carrying its first drivers across the bay late Monday night just hours before the beginning of the work week. The reopening came after the California Highway Patrol conducted a final security check and toll takers resumed their positions following a five-day closure as crews completed striping, railing and other final details on the new gleaming white span. Cars began lining up hours earlier in an attempt to be among the first on the new span, and CHP officers led a line of drivers across at about 10:15 p.m., some seven hours before the 5 a.m. Tuesday reopening that was estimated before the closure.

Open road: Traffic flows across the new eastern span of the San Francisco Oakland Bay Bridge on Tuesday . At a modest inaugural ceremony, the new, self-anchored suspension bridge with its looming, single white tower was praised as a dramatic safety upgrade over its predecessor and a beautiful example of public art. 'I hope this is more than just connecting two land masses,' said Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. 'I hope that the progress that's being represented at this moment is for a generation to dream big dreams and to do big things.' Newsom, the former mayor of San Francisco, cut a chain with a blow torch to mark the opening after leading those gathered around the bridge's toll plaza in a countdown to the reopening. There was no public celebration with tens of thousands of pedestrians and fireworks as originally planned. Instead, after years of delays and cost overruns, the opening of one of the state's most expensive public works projects was marked with a relatively low-key event that did not even include the governor.

'Despite the journey's length, it has been completed before the arrival of our next big earthquake,' said Steve Heminger, executive director of the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. 'And thank goodness for that.' Heminger was among numerous officials who spoke at the event, which included a poem about the bridge by California's poet laureate, Juan Felipe Herrera. '(This project) has at times inspired me, challenged me, frustrated me and today, after seeing the final product, it impresses me with its beauty, its grace and its strength,' said Brian Kelly, who heads the state's Business, Transportation & Housing Agency.

'California must do a better job going forward on all of our public works projects,' he said. In March, more than two dozen rods used to anchor the roadway to important earthquake safety structures cracked after they were tightened. The discovery threatened to delay the bridge's opening by months. The bridge will open with a temporary fix for the broken rods while the permanent repair, expected to be completed in December, is being installed. Transportation officials approved the temporary fix last month and voted to open the bridge as originally planned around the Labor Day weekend. But Gordon said Monday that there was not enough time for a public celebration. Plans for such a celebration originally called for a bridge walk with more than 100,000 people, fireworks, a half marathon and a concert."
"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . UPDATED: . 05:28 EST, 17 May 2012 . Thierry Henry has abandoned plans to build a giant fish tank in a house he wants knock down and re-develop because it doesn't suit the needs of his family. The ex-Arsenal striker was given the green light to demolish his £6million mansion in Hampstead, North London, and build another but there was a last minute change to the application. Documents submitted to Camden Council a day before it was due to go before a planning committee are pretty much the same but with an omission - the three-storey aquarium. Footballer Thierry Henry's new house plan has angered his neighbours but now the plan for an aquarium (bottom left) will not go ahead . The original plans showed a 40ft high fish tank stretching 15ft across and going from from the basement up to the roof of the second floor. The four separate tanks on top of one another would have been worth around £250,000 and would have held 5,500 gallons of water. It would have housed 300 fish and cost £12,000 a year to run, making the super-size aquariums owned by the likes of Madonna, the Beckhams and Premier League footballer Stephen Ireland look like tiddlers. One local, who asked not to be named, said: 'Thierry obviously had his heart set on the aquarium. 'But in the end everyone around here was saying he was only demolishing the old house so he could get the fish tank specially made to his liking. 'Knocking down a perfectly good 13-year-old house worth in the region of £10m is not something that is looked upon kindly if it is just to put a fish tank in, so a lot of us think he got round the council simply by saying he would get rid of the aquarium.' Flash home: Conti, whose garden backs on to Henry's home, and seven others have urged planning officials halt the proposal saying 'If someone wants a larger house why do they not just buy one somewhere else?' Celebrity battle: Henry, left was urged by neighbour Tom Conti, right, to move out of his £6 million London home rather than demolish it for a larger house to accommodate a monster 40ft fish tank . Actor Tom Conti, who is a neighbour of Henry's in Hampstead, north London, led an attack against the plans, but the councillors gave their consent for the building to be knocked down and re-built. Henry - Arsenal’s record goalscorer who now plays for the New York Red Bulls - did not attend the meeting. Camden councillor Jonathan Simpson described the designs as ‘fantastic’, adding: ‘It is an outstanding contribution to the borough.’ Conti, the 70-year-old actor best known for his portrayal of Greek taverna owner Costas in the film Shirley Valentine, claimed the building of the house would cause massive disruption and was not suited to the area. Henry argues that his house, built in 1999, has aged badly and is not fit for purpose as a family home. Plans: Henry intends to rebuild his Hampstead home, although the original architect Sir Richard MacCormac is opposed to the demolition . ‘Its interior spaces are cramped, deteriorated and commercial in feel, with low ceilings, narrow rooms and poor daylight,’ according to papers submitted to the council by Montagu Evans, the agents acting on his behalf. The row in leafy Hampstead has been brewing since February, when French footballer Henry applied for planning permission. The French footballer – who fronted the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault – is the latest in a long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks. Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on opulent fish tanks. Ireland has reportedly spent more than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a shark tank under his kitchen floor. It has been suggested that the celebrity obsession with aquariums may not be just about a fondness for fish. One tank designer, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Our client list tends to be male-dominated and they are looking for status symbols and showpieces.’ Henry bought his house in 2001 when he was married to model Claire Merry. The couple divorced in 2007. But he is understood to be keen to maintain his London base to be close to their young daughter, Tea. His new home will also include a swimming pool and gym. The French footballer - who fronted the ‘va-va-voom’ TV adverts for car firm Renault - is the latest in a long line of celebrities to take an interest in flashy fish tanks. Madonna, the Beckhams, Cher and Premier League footballers Stephen Ireland, Joe Hart and Micah Richards, have all splashed out on massive fish tanks. Ireland has reportedly spent more than £100,000 on his 13ft aquarium, and is now believed to be planning a shark tank under his kitchen floor. Henry’s new home is expected to take about six months to complete. Before news of the successful planning application Mr Conti said: ‘They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months. 'There are a lot of retired people round here or people like me who work from home – I write – and it’s a terrible disturbance.‘Why do they have to knock it down? I’ve never met Thierry Henry and I’ve got nothing against the man at all. I’m sure he’s a very nice man and he’s welcome to build whatever he likes. But please not here, not next to me, with all the noise.’ Conti added: ‘This used to be a wonderful place to live, but in the last ten years there’s been endless, endless building.’They’ll be drilling into the basement and it’ll go on for months and months. Trading is only permitted under strict Government regulations. The house’s original architect, Sir Richard MacCormac, a former chairman of the Royal Institute of British Architects, opposed Henry’s application. He said the house has ‘good daylighting and is in good condition but appears not to have been well maintained’. Influential civic group the Heath and Hampstead Society had also called for the application to be thrown out, saying the design of the new house ‘has no style or elegance’."
"As Gareth Bale guided a shot past Israel goalkeeper Ofir Marciano in the 77th minute on Saturday evening, Wales fans could be forgiven for getting a little carried away. Not only with their side's impressive victory - a 3-0 win over the Group B leaders away from home - but with the continuing brilliance of their two-goal talisman. Bale's double in Haifa and assist for Aaron Ramsey sent Chris Coleman's men top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group to give supporters hope of a first appearance at a major finals since 1958. Gareth Bale celebrates scoring his first goal of the game during Wales' 3-0 victory against Israel on Saturday . But as well as strengthening Wales' chances of a trip to France next summer, Bale's performance served to further enhance his reputation as a Dragons legend in the making. After months of criticism in Spain, the Real Madrid forward reminded everyone of his ability with a clever header to set up Ramsey, stunning free-kick to make it 2-0 and powerful finish to kill Israel off. Still only 25, Bale already has more goals (16) than Wales greats John Charles (15) and Ryan Giggs (12). And with a place at the European Championships at stake, the former Tottenham man has the perfect opportunity to surpass both in the hearts of fans, too. Ryan Giggs celebrates during his playing days with Wales team-mates having scored for his country . Wales legend John Charles, firing in a header, helped guide Wales to the 1958 World Cup quarter-finals . The Wales talisman gets ready to sign a shirt for a fan during a training session with children in Haifa . John Charles . 38 caps (1950–65), 15 goals . World Cup quarter-finals 1958 .

Ryan Giggs . 64 caps (1991-2007), 12 goals . Club: Manchester United (1990-2014) Major honours: 13 Premier League titles, 4 FA Cups, 2 Champions Leagues, 3 League Cups, 1 FIFA Club World Cup, 1 UEFA Super Cup . Gareth Bale . 49 caps (2006-pres), 16 goals . Clubs: Southampton, Tottenham, Real Madrid . Major honours: Champions League, Copa del Rey, FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Super Cup (All 2014) It was Charles who led Wales to the World Cup in Sweden 57 years ago, giving the country an all-too-rare chance to test themselves against the best teams on the planet. They reached the quarter-finals on that occasion, losing narrowly to eventual winners Brazil as Pele grabbed the only goal of the game. Charles, who scored in a group stage draw with Hungary, missed out on the last-eight clash after being injured against the same opponents in a play-off. Bale plays football with a group of children from Arab and Jewish communities in a training session in Haifa . Bale fires homes with a brilliant free-kick as Wales won 3-0 in Israel in the Euro 2016 group B qualifier . But such was his influence on the team that Wales manager Jim Murphy remarked: 'with John Charles in the side we might have won'. It was a view backed up by Charles' former international team-mate Terry Medwin in an interview last year. He told BBC Sport: 'Had he (Charles) been fit enough to play, I'm not saying we would have won, but he was such a great player.' Similarly, it would be hard to imagine where Wales might be without the injection of quality which Bale brings. Former Manchester United favourites Ryan Giggs (right) and David Beckham (left) vie for possession . Bale (centre) leads the celebrations after his second-half free kick put Wales 2-0 up against rivals Israel . John Charles won 38 caps for Wales from 1950-1965, helping them win the 1960 British Home Championship . Would they have beaten Israel without him in the team? Possibly, but there's no chance it would have been as comfortable a victory as we witnessed on Saturday night. Giggs can also claim to be among Wales' finest players, having pulled on the famous red shirt on 64 occasions during his distinguished club career with Manchester United. But he could never quite replicate Charles and drag his country to a major tournament. Giggs, in action for Wales versus Italy, never managed to qualify for a major tournament with his national side . Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale celebrates with the 2014 Champions League trophy next to Luka Modric . Charles (centre) rises highest to out-jump England defenders during a World Cup qualifier in Cardiff in 1953 . Wales would have made it to the 1994 World Cup had they beaten Romania in their final qualifier in November, 1993, but they lost 2-1 at Adams Park. And a decade later they missed out on a place at Euro 2004 after losing 1-0 to Russia in a two-legged play-off. Speaking after watching his side go top of their group on Saturday, Wales boss Coleman said: 'We nearly did it in 1994 and 2004 and now we have the opportunity to go a step further. 'People say it's a golden generation but we need to earn it. We're doing it but we've not done it yet. 'We want the chance to prove since 1958 this team is as good as anything that's gone before.' Fire Wales to Euro 2016 and Bale may well be regarded as the greatest Welsh player of all time. Giggs, who picked up 64 international caps, salutes the Wales fans having scored for his country ."
"Wanted: A terrorist believed to have been involved in a horrific suicide bomb attack in Bulgaria last week has emerged as one of the biggest security threats to the Olympics. A sketch of the man is pictured . A terrorist believed to have been involved in a horrific suicide bomb attack in Bulgaria last week has emerged as one of the biggest security threats to the Olympics. The man is thought to be carrying a U.S. passport under the name of David Jefferson and fled following the attack which killed six people last Wednesday in the resort of Burgas. He has emerged as a top target for Israeli security agents who fear their athletes will be attacked by an Iranian terror squad operating in Europe. The terrorist, who is suspected of helping the suicide bomber, is thought to have another powerful bomb similar to the one which destroyed the Israeli tourist bus. Following the Israeli concerns, security has been stepped up around its athletes taking part in the Games. MI5 and Scotland Yard are thought to have raised their threat assessment against the Israeli delegation as Britain prepares for the largest peacetime security operation ahead of the opening of the Olympics this Friday. According to The Sunday Times, the Israeli government - fearing a repeat of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich when 11 of its athletes and coaches were murdered - has sent agents from its internal security service Shin Bet to increase the protection around its Olympic team.

But a source in the Jewish community in London said: 'There is a pattern emerging with a build-up of attacks against Israelis and Jewish targets by Iran or Hezbollah over the past year. There is a real fear about this.' The Metropolitan police commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe suggested last week that extra security measures had been taken to protect Olympic delegations which could be targeted by terrorists.

Protecting the Olympic Park and 26 other venues will be 17,000 troops and 7,000 private security guards. Sniffer dogs and airport-style security screening will also be in place at every entrance to the stadium and snipers will be in place on the roof.

"By . Associated Press . The attorney for a woman who nearly died after unknowingly drinking toxic iced tea at a Utah restaurant says an employee at the eatery burned herself a month earlier on the same chemical cleaning compound. Lawyer Paxton Guymon said Thursday the former Dickey's Barbecue employee burned her tongue July 5. He says she stuck her finger in a sugar container and licked it to see if it contained any of the chemical cleaner. Guymon says he's appalled that the South Jordan restaurant didn't get rid of the sugar container mixed with the chemical lye before it ended up in the tea that Jan Harding drank August 10. Another victim: Jan Harding's attorney Paxton Guyman says his client wasn't the only person to drink lye-laced tea at a Dickey's Barbecue in Utah . Injuries: Jan Harding (left), a mother of three, suffered deep burns to her upper esophagus and was in critical condition for a week after drinking the tea. Her husband Jim spoke Thursday and said he's grateful she's finally getting better after being on the brink of death . On Thursday, Harding's husband Jim announced that she is recovering well.  He says he's not upset and doesn't want retribution for what happened. 'I’m just grateful for each day,' he said. 'I’m grateful that she’s getting better. I’m grateful that she has a voice. I’m grateful that the life and death thing has been taken off the table. I’m just grateful for where we are. I bring you a good word today, an encouraging word.' Dickey's Barbecue Restaurants Inc. has said the customer's injuries were an isolated incident. Jan Harding, 67, is listed in good condition at a Salt Lake City hospital as she continues to improve, said University of Utah Health Care spokeswoman Kathy Wilets. The mother-of-three suffered deep burns in her upper esophagus and was in critical condition for a week after taking a single sip of the tea that contained an industrial cleaning solution. Mrs Harding, a married mother of three, drank the lye-laced tea at this South Jordan restaurant on August 10 . She has been steadily improving this week and can now breathe on her own and talk a bit, family attorney Paxton Guyton has said. Getting better: Harding's husband announced Thursday that she is recovering and able to speak again after drinking the toxic tea . Authorities say a worker at Dickey’s Barbecue in South Jordan unintentionally put the chemical cleaning compound in a sugar bag last month. The substance ended up in Harding’s glass of iced tea after an employee mixed it into a beverage dispenser. The police agency looking into the incident has finished its investigation. Rather than making arrests and recommending charges, South Jordan police have asked prosecutors to determine if anyone should be charged because several people possibly played a role. Salt Lake County District Attorney Sim Gill said it will likely take several more days to review evidence and interviews and make a decision. The Hardings, who live in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy, went to the restaurant after church to meet friends for lunch. They had not even ordered yet when she took a sip of the tea. The cleaning product in the drink was meant for degreasing deep fryers and contained the odorless chemical lye, the active ingredient in drain cleaners. Overall, this Dickey’s has maintained a better-than-average health rating since opening in 2012, said Salt Lake County Health Department spokesman Nicholas Rupp this week. County officials issued seven violations following a January inspection, including for improper food labeling, county records show. The year before, the restaurant had six violations. Dickey’s Barbecue Restaurants Inc. issued a statement last week that it was an isolated incident and nothing like it had happened in the 73 years the Dallas-based chain has operated. Consequences: Prosecutors are currently deciding whether to bring up charges against the Utah restaurant for poisoning the customer ."

"Tokyo (CNN) -- A 63-year-old man wanted in connection with the murder of five people in a remote Japanese hamlet has been captured after a manhunt involving more than 400 police. Three bodies were found on Sunday after two houses in Mitake, a tiny community in western Japan's Yamaguchi prefecture, were gutted by a ""suspicious"" fire, Yamaguchi police spokesman Katsumi Harada told CNN on Wednesday. The following morning, two more corpses were found a few hundred meters away in the same neighborhood in the victims' respective homes. An autopsy revealed that all five victims were killed by injuries to the head, prompting police to set up a task force to investigate a possible serial killer, Harada said. The wanted man -- who lived next to the burned out houses -- disappeared, prompting a huge manhunt. Police found the man in the mountains barely 1 km from the village. He was barefoot, wearing only his underwear when he was discovered, police spokesman Kazutaka Umemoto told CNN. The man was then taken to the nearest police station at Shunan for questioning. The case attracted significant media attention after a note, apparently written in the form of a ""haiku"" poem -- a short form of Japanese verse -- was left hanging in the window of the fugitive man's home. According to the authorities, the poem translated as: ""Setting on fire, smoke gives delight, to country fellows."" They have refused to draw a link between the poem and the killings. Mitake is a remote, mountainous community with less than 20 inhabitants. According to local media, the arrested man lived alone, and moved into the neighborhood about 20 years ago to take care of his elderly parents. Reports suggested the man grew increasingly alienated in the small community after his parents died about 7-8 years ago. One of the victims frequently quarreled with him over his dog, according to Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest newspaper."
"London, England (CNN) -- The British government will compensate a number of British residents who were interned at Guantanamo Bay, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke announced Tuesday, saying he could not reveal the amount of compensation. ""The settlement is not to be taken as any admission of liability,"" he said, portraying it as a way of resolving lawsuits against the British government so that an independent inquiry into torture allegations could get started. ""It was not in the interest of any party to get stuck in litigation,"" Clarke told the House of Commons. ""It could have taken years, it could have cost tens of millions of pounds,"" he said. ""It was a difficult and unusual situation, but it was the right thing to do. I think we've saved public money."" The settlement will cover all British citizens and residents who were held at the U.S. military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, as far as the British government is aware, Clarke said. At least six men had filed suit against the British government, seeking damages over human rights violations they say they suffered during their rendition to and detention at various locations, including Guantanamo Bay. The British government inquiry into the issue -- announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in July -- could not begin until the suits were settled, Clarke said. Police investigations will also have to be finished before the so-called Gibson inquiry can begin, he said. Amnesty International said that the British government isn't going far enough. ""Financial compensation can be an important part of the right to remedy and reparation for victims of grave human rights violations. However, it remains only one part,"" said Amnesty official Nicola Duckworth. The human rights group said lawyers acting for the British government have repeatedly sought to prevent disclosure of relevant material, and had argued for closed procedures allowing courts to consider secret material presented by U.K. authorities in closed sessions. And in the United States, the American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the British action while condeming Washington for not following suit. ""Here in the United States, the Obama administration continues to shield the architects of the torture program from civil liability,"" said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU. ""If other democracies can compensate survivors and hold officials accountable for their endorsement of torture, surely we can do the same,"" he said."
"By . David Williams . Plot: Samantha Lewthwaite planned to attack Western-linked buildings in Kenya . British fugitive Samantha Lewthwaite has been officially named as a ‘key actor’ in an Al Qaeda-linked plot to blow up Kenya’s Parliament and the United Nations offices in Nairobi. The so-called ‘White Widow’ - the world’s most wanted woman - is also said to have been part of a terrorist cell targeting Kenyan Defence Force camps, Western embassies and the assassination of the country’s top politicians. A Kenyan intelligence report leaked yesterday links the widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay to Abdulkadir Mohamed Abdulkadir, the man U.S. Navy Seals were hunting in a ‘kill or capture’ mission in Somalia at the weekend. He is said to have been the mastermind of the multiple plots in Kenya in late 2011 and early 2012 which the report says were sanctioned by Al Qaeda’s core leadership in Pakistan. It is the first time the Home Counties mother-of-four has been named in connection with the plots which were foiled by the Kenyan authorities, underlining her importance to Somali-based, Al Qaeda-inspired terror groups. The 29 year-old had only been previously linked to alleged plots to blow up Western hotels in Mombasa and a grenade attack on a popular bar in the Indian Ocean resort. Al-Shabaab terrorists, seen here, are believed to pose a worldwide security threat . Lewthwaite, who was named last month . on an Interpol international arrest warrant, escaped capture in Mombasa . when she produced a fraudulently obtained South African passport in . another person’s name and convinced officers she was not the Briton they . were hunting. The . detailed report will raise new questions over whether Lewthwaite played . any role in the planning of the Westgate shopping mall attack on . September 21 in which 60 people died. In . the immediate aftermath of that attack, reports suggested she may have . been among the gunmen but this has now been questioned. It . will raise questions too over why there was not greater security in . place at one of Nairobi’s premier shopping centres after intelligence . officers spelt out in the report how a year earlier they knew of plans . for an attack there. Close proximity: The Navy SEAL raid in the coastal town of Baraawe was about 130 miles south of Mogadishu . Wanted: Samantha Lewthwaite, known as the 'White Widow,' is one of the world's most hunted terrorists . The . National Intelligence Service report, in an entry dated exactly one . year before the mall attack, said operatives of the Somali-based . Islamist group Al Shabaab were in Nairobi ‘and are planning to mount . suicide attacks on undisclosed date, targeting Westgate Mall and Holy . Family Basilica.’ Two suspects were believed in possession of suicide vests, grenades and AK-47 assault rifles, the report said. The . men who attacked the Westgate mall and held off besieging Kenyan troops . for several days were armed with grenades and AK-47s, but apparently . had no suicide vests. It . was unclear if one planned attack on the mall was foiled and then . carried out again or if it was merely postponed for a year by Al . Shabaab, which claimed responsibility for the carnage. The . internal document shows that Kenyan intelligence officers have detailed . information about plots and individuals tasked with carrying them out. Other . targeted sites included the capital’s Hilton Hotel, the Yaya shopping . mall, the office of the prime minister, and possibly the embassies of . the United States - which was blown up by Al Qaeda in 1998 - and of . Britain and Israel."
"Residents of an historic Kent market town fear a tourism backlash after allowing a thriller about a serial killer to be filmed there. Channel 4 filmed their new four-part drama Southcliffe in the town of Faversham. But when the local people gave their permission they believed it was a murder mystery not an account of a loner that embarks on a killing spree. The people of Faversham fear a tourism backlash after Channel 4 filmed their knew thriller in the town . Residents of Faversham allowed film crews into their home, but claim they thought it was a murder mystery . The show is inspired by the Hungerford massacre in 1987 and the Whitehaven shootings, reported The Independent. Southcliffe focusses on a loner ex-soldier who begins to kill after being persecuted by oppressive neighbours. The Faversham Enterprise Partnership claimed that the show, which is produced by Warp Films, would generate £500,000 for the local economy. Southcliffe features Stephen (played by Sean Harris), who embarks on a killing spree in the town . David Simmons, Mayor of Faversham said: ‘The impression I got was that they were making a crime series like Midsomer Murders. We had no idea of the storyline.’ Residents opened their doors and allowed crews to film inside their homes for the show. ITV’s Broadchurch encouraged a tourism boom in West Bay, Dorset, something that the town wanted to emulate. Mayor Simmons added: ‘We hoped that the filming would be of economic benefit to the town. The crew stayed locally and people let them use their houses.’ The producres say that Southcliffe is not about the murderer, but the community and how they react to a tragic event . David Simmons, Mayor of Faversham said that he thought they were filming a murder mystery similar to Midsomer Murders . But, the creators of Southcliffe said that it is not the story of a killer, but how the town reacts to a tragic incident and the community spirit of the place. Director Sean Durkin said: ‘It was about spending time in the area where we were shooting to see what it felt like to sit in a pub there, what it felt like to walk down the street. There was a palpable atmosphere.’ Bryan Mulhearn, councillor for Swale, said that he thinks there should be a screening in the town, with the chance for the producers to explain why they picked Faversham for the programme."
"Arrest: Reggie Hardy allegedly punched a man and cut off his dreadlocks after finding him in his home . A father punched a 19-year-old in the face and chopped off his dreadlocks after he found him sneaking around his apartment with his teenage daughter, police have said. Reginald Hardy has said he is sorry for attacking the unnamed man after he found him inside his Reading, Pennsylvania home on Friday night. Hardy, whose daughter only moved in with him a few weeks ago, said he saw people running through his apartment and into his bathroom. 'Then we got into a little scuffle,' he told WFMZ. Court documents reveal Hardy punched the teenager in the face, grabbed him by the hair and dragged him into the kitchen, where he sliced off his dreadlocks with a knife. As the man attempted to leave, Hardy told him not to run because he had a gun and would shoot him in the back, according to documents. 'That might have been the maddest I ever got because I literally just seen red,' he said. After the attack, he was charged with aggravated assault, terroristic threats and other offenses. Police say Hardy cooperated with the investigation. He's free on $50,000 unsecured bail and is due in court for a preliminary hearing on January 12. Scroll down for video .

"Kano, Nigeria  (CNN)Boko Haram failed attempts to seize the key Nigerian city of Maiduguri on Sunday, the militants' second attack there in a week. Islamist extremists tried to enter Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, during a predawn attack after the army fought them off last week. Gunfire raged for hours outside the city, residents said. ""Fighting has been going on since 3 a.m. as Boko Haram battles soldiers and vigilantes,"" said Mahmud Kyari, who lives in Maiduguri. ""Explosions and gunfire are all we hear."" The militants launched bomb and gun attacks from three points outside the city, but met stiff resistance from troops and vigilantes, residents said. Government officials said fighter jets were pounding the insurgents. ""Boko Haram gunmen have been routed and are on the run,"" said Sadiq Balarabe, another resident. Soldiers repelled attacks in Maiduguri on January 25, but the extremists seized the nearby town of Monguno and its military barracks. Monguno is 135 kilometers (85 miles) from Maiduguri. Both cities are near the Chad and Cameroon borders, which would give the militants an entry point into those countries. Monguno and its military post had served as a buffer to keep the militants away from Maiduguri. Its fall left Maiduguri vulnerable to capture by the militants. Borno Gov. Kashim Shettima said young people from the state joined the military and vigilantes in the fight to repel Boko Haram. The youths ""sacrificed their lives and moved to frontlines to support our gallant armed forces in a patriotic battle to defend the soul of Borno state and its people from being seized by determined insurgents,"" he said in a statement. ""I am confident that as a people, we can overcome the threat of insurgents,"" Shettima said. ""Borno is our land, we cannot and we must not allow anyone push us out of our land."" The governor said he is not asking citizens to take justice into their own hands, but to register and get training to support the military. The latest attacks come as Nigeria prepares for elections February 14. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry was in the nation last month to call for peaceful voting. In neighboring Yobe state, a suicide blast Sunday outside the home of a prominent politician killed seven people and injured several others, a police officer and witnesses said. Sabo Garbu, a candidate of Nigeria's ruling Peoples Democratic Party, was not injured in the explosion. It occurred while he was holding a meeting with his campaign team at his home in Potiskum town. ""We were outside the house when a bus pulled over and an unkempt man‎ was pushed out,"" said Tijjani Mamman, who was among a crowd of supporters outside the home at the time of the blast. ""The bus drove off and before anybody realized what was happening , the man exploded."" Though one has claimed responsibility for Sunday's blast, Boko Haram has carried out a spate of suicide attacks in Potiskum in recent weeks. Boko Haram has terrorized northern Nigeria regularly since 2009, attacking police, schools, churches and civilians, as well as bombing government buildings. The Islamist group has said its aim is to impose a stricter form of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south.

Yahoo has adopted a new logo for the first time since shortly after the Internet company's founding 18 years ago. The redesigned look unveiled early this morning is part of a makeover that Yahoo has been undergoing since the Sunnyvale, California, company hired Google executive Marissa Mayer to become CEO 14 months ago. She has already spruced up Yahoo's front page, email and Flickr photo-sharing service, as well as engineering a series of acquisitions aimed at attracting more traffic on mobile devices. The new Yahoo logo and (inset) the old one which has now disappeared . The shopping spree has been highlighted by Yahoo's $1.1billion (£720million) purchase of Tumblr, an Internet blogging service where the company rolled out its new logo. The logo was shown in purple spelling out the word Yahoo!, with no letters touching and ending with an exclamation point. 'We wanted a logo that stayed true to our roots (whimsical, purple, with an exclamation point) yet embraced the evolution of our products' a statement on the website said. In an effort to drum up more interest in the changeover, Yahoo spent the past 30 days showing some of the proposed logos that Ms Mayer and other executives cast aside. The revision is the first time that Yahoo has made a significant change to its logo since a few tweaks shortly after co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo incorporated the company in 1995. Ms Mayer's overhaul of Yahoo has attracted a lot of attention, but so far it has not provided a significant lift to the company's revenue. Yahoo depends on internet advertising to make most of its money, an area where the company's growth has been anaemic while more marketing cash flows to rivals such as Google and Facebook. Yahoo's stock has climbed by nearly 80%, but most of that gain has been driven by the company's 24% stake in China's Alibaba Holdings Group. Investors prize Alibaba because it has emerged as one of the fastest growing companies on the internet.

North Korea is armed with ‘powerful modern weapons’ capable of defeating the United States with a ‘single blow’, a military chief warned today. Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho emphasised the importance of strengthening the military to defend the Communist state against threats it sees from the U.S. and South Korea. He called his nation a nuclear and military power and praised new leader Kim Jong Un, believed to be in his late 20s, as a ‘military strategist’ who has been giving the army guidance for years. Big guns: North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, right, with his military advisers Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, center, and Vice Marshal Ri Yong Ho, who claimed the country could defeat the U.S. with a single missile strike . ‘The Korean People's Army is armed with powerful modern weapons ... that can defeat the (U.S.) imperialists at a single blow,’ he told party and military officials, using familiar descriptions of the country's rivals. The meeting, attended by Kim Jong Un, was held to mark the 80th anniversary of the army's founding. It comes amid increased speculation abroad about the nation's missile arsenal and nuclear ambitions. Ri, who is chief of the army's General Staff, did not provide further details about North Korea's weapons, but his call to arms comes as the United States, Britain and others warn the nation against a provocation that would further heighten tensions.

"(CNN) -- Two former World Cup champions face off Thursday in Brazil, but neither England nor Uruguay have been in dominant form lately. They both lost their first matches this year and will be hungry for a win to keep hopes alive of advancing to the knockout round of the competition. England, the 1966 champions, have lost their last two World Cup matches. Uruguay, who have won the World Cup twice, have lost their last three matches. Uruguay holds the distinction of being the only champion who didn't defend its crown. The South American nation hosted and won the 1930 tournament, but refused to participate in 1934 in Italy because the Italians didn't show up four years earlier. It's already clear that the defending champions this year will not be repeating their triumph. Spain, the dominant national team in European and world football for most of the past decade, crashed out of the World Cup in shocking style Wednesday night, with a 2-0 loss to Chile that makes it impossible for the title holders to advance to the knockout stage of the tournament. It was a surprise result, but arguably not an unusual one: The Spanish are the fifth defending champions to be eliminated in the group stage of the World Cup. That's more than a quarter of all title holders ever to to try to repeat. It's more common for a defending champ not to make it to the knockout stage than to win the World Cup twice in a row. Champions who went out early: . Italy: Won in 1938, eliminated in 1950 (there were no World Cups in between because of World War II) Brazil: won in 1962, eliminated in 1966 . France: won in 1998, eliminated in 2002 . Italy: won in 2006, eliminated in 2010 . Spain: won in 2010, eliminated in 2014 .

"By . Alice Smellie . My five-year-old daughter, Lara, caused something of a stir at the school gates last week as she waltzed in with a canvas rucksack slung across her shoulders. Because this was no ordinary rucksack. This was Chanel’s highly sought-after canvas graffiti backpack, designed by creative director Karl Lagerfeld for  his Pop Art collection, modelled at  Paris Fashion Week by model of the moment, Cara Delevingne, and, despite the eye-watering price of £2,100, already a sell-out. Except it wasn’t. What sort of a mother do you think I am? I would no more buy my daughter a Chanel bag  than I would buy her a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos. Scroll down for video . 'Homage': Alice (left) and Lara (right) pose with their take on the designer bag . This was, in fact, a fake. But I don’t like the term fake — it conjures up images of nasty backstreet market stalls and ill-gotten gains funding drug cartels. I prefer to think of this as a carefully crafted, handmade homage. Let me explain. When I saw the pictures of this coveted and unattainable item I thought I must be mistaken. Rather than being the elegant leather accessory Chanel is famous for, this resembles the kind of customised and grubby backpack touted around by particularly scruffy school children. But cooler and richer people clearly disagree. Twilight star Kristen Stewart was spotted in Paris in March carrying  a black version of the backpack, complete with her trademark skinny jeans and sneakers. In a magnificent truism, Lagerfeld  said of the collection that spawned the bag: ‘Life is not a red carpet. This is for daily life.’ But of course, because we all drag  £2,100 backpacks round Sainsbury’s, don’t we? Frankly, this bag looked like it had been made by a five-year-old. Which, of course, made me wonder: Could a five-year-old make it? I decided to find out. Lara was up for the challenge, so I scoured the internet to find a basic bag that we could customise. I finally found a plain beige canvas rucksack on Amazon.co.uk, costing just £7 — which would buy me approximately one third of a Chanel lipgloss (£22). Lara (left), aged 5, poses with the homage to the designer bag (right) she made with her mother Alice . For the all-important Chanel logo, Helen McLaughlin, editor of new magazine Love Sewing, advises I use freezer paper. This is sold by craft shops, and is ordinary paper on one side and has a thin plastic coating on the other. This means that when you iron the plain side, it sticks to fabric. Using a cereal bowl and a mug as a template for the concentric circles that make up the interlinking ‘C’s, Lara draws the design on to the freezer paper, carefully cuts it out and I then iron the two ‘C’s on to the bag. We are amazed at how authentic it looks. I wonder where this might lead — Lara and I could do pencil cases and wash bags for the next school fete and make our fortune. I’m just taking the top off the red paint, a leftover from one of the children’s art projects, when we’re interrupted by a very cross voice. It’s my husband, Justin. ‘Don’t use spray paint in the kitchen,’ he thunders. ‘Go outside. On the grass.’ I bet Coco Chanel never got yelled at mid-creation. Out in the garden, we gently spray the paints on in layers  of brown, then red, then green and finally the beige, and then use some of the children’s  stencils to write the words, ‘31 Rue Cambon’. Lara (left) was in charge of plaiting and twisting a load of polyester cords that Alice (right) bought from a craft shop . The bag only cost £7 to make but Alice (left) admits: 'If we were less of an artsy-crafty . family, we might not have had everything we needed and I would have had . to spend about £50 on materials.' Pictured: Lara (right) Now, we have to make the — frankly messy looking — rope of tangled cord and carabiners, those weird hooks used by mountaineers, and, fortuitously, my husband for securing his bike to the car. Why on earth they are on a fashion backpack is beyond me. I task Lara with plaiting and twisting a load of polyester cords that I bought from a craft shop, and then, to make the final, smaller Chanel ‘C’s in silver and white, we draw around a pepperpot and then outline the edges of the ‘C’s with a silver pen. We are shamelessly pleased with the final result and  prance around like delighted show ponies. My husband, who has been sniggering as he watches us painstakingly plait, spray and glue, is genuinely impressed. (OK, his exact words were: ‘It’s really good, I thought it was going to be rubbish.’) I have a host of arty friends whom I text with a picture of the bag. They are similarly wowed — one claims not to be able to tell the difference at all. I’m pretty sure that everyone (myself included) assumed  that this project was going to be a disaster. If we were less of an artsy-crafty family, we might not have had everything we needed and I would have had to spend about £50 on materials. Still, that’s about one fortieth of the retail price of the real thing. Now all we need is for some sap to offer more than £2,100  for our version, and we really  will be laughing all the way to the bank. But not as much as Chanel, who have created a bag so simple that even a five-year-old can make a convincing copy."
"North Korea may already have 20 nuclear warheads - double as many as previously thought, Chinese nuclear experts have warned. The pariah state may also have the capability to produce enough weapons-grade uranium to double its arsenal by next year, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Chinese estimates of Pyongyang's nuclear production, relayed to US nuclear specialists, exceed most previous US forecasts of between 10 to 16 bombs, said the report, which cited people briefed on the matter. Scroll down for video . A North Korean vehicle carrying a missile passes by during a mass military parade in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square. The pariah state may have as many as 20 nuclear warheads, it has now been suggested . North Korean leader Kim Jong Un addresses Korean People's Army pilots in an undated photo released by the state news agency earlier this month. Under the Kim dynasty North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations . Experts at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies earlier this year presented three scenarios for North Korea's nuclear capability, predicting its stockpile of weapons could grow to 50 or even 100 within five years. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013. Asked about the report at a regular press briefing yesterday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said he 'did not have knowledge of the specific situation'. 'We must persevere with denuclearisation on the Korean peninsula, persevere in safeguarding peace and stability, and persevere in resolving the relevant issue through dialogue,' Hong said. Earlier this month, US Admiral William Gortney, commander of the US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command, said the US military believes North Korea has the ability to miniaturise a warhead and mount it on a ballistic missile, although there had been no tests. One such rocket is an intercontinental missile with could theoretically hit California as it is designed to carry a payload of more than 5,000 miles. Kim Jong Un (centre in black) posing with his soldiers on top of snow-covered Mount Paektu in North Korea. The country could have as many as 100 warheads within five years, it has been suggested . Stanford University professor Sigfried Hecker was allowed to visit Pyongyang in 2010 and reported seeing a large uranium-enrichment facility. The Journal quoted him as saying: 'Some eight, nine, or 10 years ago, they had the bomb but not much of a nuclear arsenal. 'I had hoped they wouldn't go in this direction, but that's what happened in the past five years. 'The more they believe they have a fully functional nuclear arsenal and deterrent, the more difficult it's going to be to walk them back from that.' North Korea carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013, and has an extremely active ballistic missile development programme, although expert opinion is split on how much progress it has made, reports Agence France Presse. The Chinese estimate reflects growing concern in Beijing about the nuclear ambitions of its errant ally, and is the latest in a series of expert assessments that suggest Pyongyang is moving faster down the nuclear path than previously thought. Kim Jong Un inspecting the newly built Wonsan Baby Home and Orphanage in a photo released earlier this month. North Korea has conducted three nuclear detonations, the most recent in February 2013 . In 2012, Pyongyang demonstrated its rocket capabilities by sending a satellite into orbit, but it has yet to conduct a test that would show it had mastered the re-entry technology required for an inter-continental ballistic missile. The other key question is how close the North is to being able to miniaturise a nuclear device that could be fitted on the tip of a missile. In a white paper published in January, the South Korean defence ministry said the North had already taken its miniaturisation technology to a 'significant' level. Under the Kim dynasty, represented by current leader Kim Jong Un, North Korea has long used nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in international relations. Last month the country's ambassador to the UK issued a chilling warning that North Korea would be prepared to use nuclear weapons. In a rare interview, Hyun Hak-bong claimed the secretive state could launch a deadly warhead 'anytime'."
"Sportsmail asked Tottenham fans' blog the Spurs Web to reveal the mood around White Hart Lane following the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as their new manager. Joseph Meakin discusses whether the board have made the right decision and how the fans feel about their new boss. There has been a huge wave of positivity and excitement around Tottenham Hotspur Football Club, after the appointment of Mauricio Pochettino as our new head coach was confirmed. Memories of last season’s swashbuckling, confident Southampton team live strong in the memory of most Spurs fans, who seem excited to see what Pochettino can do with a squad full of players with more quality than was available at St. Mary’s. New man in charge: Mauricio Pochettino has been named as the new manager of Spurs . Whilst Ajax boss Frank de Boer was the man that most Spurs fans wanted to see take the club forward, the excitement about Pochettino speaks volumes of how well he is thought of by Tottenham fans. I always felt that Pochettino was a . much better fit to what Daniel Levy wants to achieve at White Hart Lane . than De Boer, so I am pleased that we have gone with the Argentinian. Pochettino’s . high-tempo, attacking philosophy can, I believe, be easily translated . to our squad, and Pochettino has managed in England long enough to have . tailored his preferred set-up to suit the physical demands of the . Premier League. On the attack: Andros Townsend can provide Spurs with an outlet for getting forward . The Pochettino way: Sandro, Mousa Dembele and Lewis Holtby play the way the new boss likes . Benefit: Erik Lamela could thrive under Pochettino's guidance . Players . like Lewis Holtby, Sandro and Mousa Dembele have both the ability and . work-rate to press the opposition how Pochettino likes, and in Christian . Eriksen, Andros Townsend and Erik Lamela, I really feel we have a . young, creative set of attacking midfielders who could all benefit from . playing in Pochettino’s exciting system. Whilst . I am very happy to see the back of Tim Sherwood, the work that Sherwood . did to promote players from the academy was refreshing. I am hopeful . that Pochettino will continue this policy at White Hart Lane, and there . is no reason why he shouldn’t. Young hope: Spurs fans would like to see players like Tom Carroll given a chance . Time to go: Spurs fans were glad to see the back of Tim Sherwood as manager . The . likes of Tom Carroll, Nabil Bentaleb, Alex Pritchard, Harry Winks, Ryan . Fredericks and Musa Yahaya are all exciting young players, and players . who will be looking to get a chance under the new manager. I’m . excited; the fans needed a change of atmosphere after the diabolic . season we have just had to endure, and a manager like Pochettino is just . what we needed. If Levy gives Pochettino time, I am confident Spurs will progress under his leadership. Read more of Joseph's views on the Spurs Web and follow them on Twitter @thespursweb ."
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 06:58 EST, 7 May 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:14 EST, 7 May 2013 . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg promised to end 'abuse' of the benefits system . Immigrants to Britain will not be able to claim benefits without proving they have contributed to the welfare state by working, under plans to be set out by the government. Benefits, housing and healthcare will be limited to new arrivals who are willing to work and paid taxes to fund state-backed support. A package of reforms will be included in tomorrow’s Queen’s Speech including major law changes needed to limit the claims that can be made by Romanians and Bulgarians when controls are lifted next year. Ministers will also use existing powers to enforce secondary legislation needed to stop ‘abuse’ of the tax and benefits system. However, government sources say the details are yet to be fleshed out, and the flagship Immigration Bill is unlikely to be published in full until the autumn. The moves will be seen as a reaction to the electoral threat posed by the UK Independence Party, which rocked the political establishment this week by taking votes and council seats from all the main parties. UKIP leader Nigel Farage focussed on the impact of immigration, and how membership of the EU stopped Britain acting to limit it, during much of the local election campaign. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg today signalled that the days of Britain’s benefits ‘free-for-all’ for foreigners were over. He said: ‘We have been very clear that we totally get that there’s a heightened level of public anxiety about immigration. ‘We should stamp out abuse and make sure our public services and benefits are not simply a free-for-all, there needs to be some relation between what you put in and what you get out,’ he told BBC Breakfast. Ministers will use the Welfare Reform Act, passed in the last year, to close a loophole that allowed migrants who no longer have a right to work here to carry on claiming benefits. The test that decides who can access benefits will also be tightened. Migrants from the European Economic Area will be told that they can only receive Jobseeker’s Allowance if they are genuinely looking for a job. It will include a tougher test to ensure they can speak English properly. The National Health Service will be given more powers to recoup costs for treating people from overseas  while access to benefits from Jobcentres will be curbed if migrants cannot speak English . Migrants will be given only six months to find a job before benefits stop, unless they can prove they are close to getting a job. David Cameron responded to fears about the appeal of Britain's benefits system in drawing immigrants to Britain. He put immigration minister Mark . Harper in charge of a Cabinet committee examining the 'pull factors' which needed to be addressed. It also included ministers for health, . housing, legal aid and welfare. Ministers are in talks with other EU countries about whether jobless migrants can be the responsibility of their home country before they start claiming benefits in the UK. Britain would also like to curb the £36million paid every year in child benefit to 24,000 families who do live in the UK. The government also wants to end the idea that the NHS is a ‘free international health service’. Efforts will be stepped up to recoup costs from migrants who use the NHS, through charging or requiring private medical insurance. David Cameron used a major speech on immigration in March to insist housing, benefits and healthcare should not be available free of charge to anyone arriving in Britain . One in ten new rentals of social homes goes to a foreign national. New guidance from this spring will set a local residence test, to ensure people with ties to a local area can get priority for housing. Migrants will have to have lived – and worked - in the UK for two years before their qualify for a state-funded home. Illegal immigrants will also face tougher checks to stop them getting driving licences, credit cards, personal loans or a council house. Mr Clegg said: ‘This Government will take further measures to ensure that, yes, of course we should be a welcoming, generous country to those people who want to come here and make a contribution. ‘But people who want to come here – worst of all illegally – or want to come here and sort of abuse our generosity and use our benefits and public services when they’re not really properly entitled to do so, yes, we need to clamp down on that,’ he told ITV’s Daybreak. ‘So, yes, to a sort of open and tolerant Britain, but no to abuse of the immigration system and that’s what we will make sure happens.’ The immigration bill expected in tomorrow's Queen's Speech will implement the major legal changes which cannot be made using secondary legislation. Mr Cameron has promised to ‘fight back very robustly’ against any attempts by the courts or the EU to block British curbs on benefits for migrants. In a speech in March, Mr the next stage of reform is to say, ‘Let’s not just reform the immigration system. Let’s make sure the housing system, the welfare system, the legal aid system, all of these things actually fit in – the health system – fit in with our immigration policy,’ sending a very clear message that people can come and work, but they can’t come for the wrong reasons."
"The idea of ""wearable robots"" may seem like something out of a movie, but this technology is already being used in real life. Started as a project for the military, the exoskeleton has transformed from a device designed to allow soldiers to lift heavy loads and walk further to one that enables people with disabilities to step out of wheelchairs and stand upright. The ""Ekso"" is a bionic exoskeleton developed by Ekso Bionics that gives paraplegics upright mobility. While the commercial version of the Ekso has recently been made available to hospitals and rehabilitation centers, the company hopes to make the technology more accessible so that people can use it at home and in their everyday lives, with a personal version releasing in 2014. CEO Eythor Bender sat down with CNN to talk about Ekso, the bionic exoskeleton he helped develop. CNN: How many years have you been working on exoskeletons? Bender: We have been working on exoskeletons for the last 10 years. It started as a project with the military and it was funded by DARPA, the same people who funded the Internet and GPS systems. So it was groundbreaking technology, and in the year 2005 we had a breakthrough in terms of making sure that the weight of the exoskeleton transfers all the way down to the ground. So the user who is wearing it -- it usually weighs up to 50 pounds -- doesn't feel the weight at all. And that's so important because obviously you are trying to make their lives easier, not more difficult. CNN: What powers the exoskeleton? Bender: What we are using here is electric motors, and there are four of them, which is actually quite unique especially when you compare it to (technology used by) amputees. Prosthetics so far have usually had one moving component, and in this case you have in one system four moving components. You have four motors -- two sitting at the hips and two at the knees -- and that's what you hear. and it's driven by a battery pack sitting on the back. In the middle, between the two batteries, is a computer and so that is pretty much it. It's an outer frame that pretty much mimics the bone structure. There are 15 sensors in it that almost re-create your nerve system. And then there is the computer, which is really the brain of the whole thing. CNN: What is your long-term hope or vision for this product in terms of helping people on the medical side? Bender: Our hope is simply to help people in wheelchairs to live a fuller life. They already live a pretty full life. They can do pretty much anything except they can't walk, and that is such a basic need if you think about it. We all learn to walk even before we learn to talk, and suddenly in the prime of your life you are deprived of that basic need. We are determined to provide at least a tool that people can have, whether it is about walking for part of the day or it is in the recovery phase or rehabilitation or simply in daily living where people want to go about and do things during the day just like an amputee would use a prosthetic leg during the whole day. CNN: Will the Ekso exoskeleton eventually be available in homes for people to use whenever they want? Bender: Yes. We see it as a companion during the whole day. It's not going to happen overnight for us to get there. We have been on this journey, working with the best rehab centers around the world improving the Ekso and making it better. But at the same time, through working with users in rehab centers, it is helping us take the first step into homes so that we can develop a product -- and it's probably going to be products -- that help people not only to gain their health back or get back on their feet, but simply to become a mobility tool similar to the wheelchair. The wheelchair by the way has been around for 1,500 years and it is pretty much the single mobility tool for people that can do pretty much anything else."
"A country barman who spent millions of dollars worth of cash he withdrew from ATMs via a 'loophole' in the system has been arrested. Dan Saunders, from Wangaratta in north-eastern Victoria, lived the high life for about four and a half months in February 2011, spending wildly on expensive escorts, private jets, exclusive restaurants and gambling. Last week A Current Affair aired details of the lavish lifestyle he lead, and Saunders revealed to the program the method he used to obtain the money. Scroll down for video . ATM scammer Dan Saunders was arrested in Melbourne on Wednesday afternoon . The country barman spent millions of dollars worth of cash he withdrew from ATMs via a 'loophole' On Thursday he was arrested by officers in Melbourne and charged with 111 offences relating to fraud and theft, a spokeswoman for Victoria Police confirmed to Daily Mail Australia. Saunders is expected to face additional charges and will front court next Wednesday. More than three years ago 29-year old-stumbled across a technical fault in the National Australia Bank's  ATM system which meant he had access to free money whenever, or wherever he pleased. 'I've never felt more alive than when I was charging on my credit card,' Mr Saunders told Australia's Current Affair. 'With the NAB card I could be anyone I wanted to be, go anywhere I wanted to go, do anything as long as I had the card in my back pocket. I felt like a king.' In 2011 Saunders (pictured) went on a wild spending spree paying for private jets, hookers and  gambling . He discovered the 'loophole' in his bank's ATM system one night when he went to get some money out while drinking with friends . 'I felt like a rock star, probably looked like a fat, white Kanye West, but you felt like you were Kanye West,' he said. In an exclusive interview with ACA, he divulged how it all unfolded one night out for beers with mates and how he quickly went on a wild spending spree, with money that was not his. - He would transfer money from credit to his savings account while ATM system was 'offline' -The ATM would read 'transaction cancelled' - but still dished out the money . - He took advantage of a loophole in the system which meant the ATM couldn't record transactions during late-night maintenance - but still dispensed cash . - The withdrawal would not  register on his account - effectively giving him free cash . - He continued withdrawing and the bank didn't catch up . - He also tricked the ATM by transferring money from his 'credit' option to his Mastercard... even though he only had one credit card . Mr Saunders had just moved to Wangaratta in country Victoria and one evening in February, 2011 he was out drinking with friends. Like most people he needed to withdraw cash from the ATM, but when he tried, he realised he just had $3 in his savings account, so what he did was transfer $200 from his credit card. 'It said transaction cancelled but it worked,' he said. $200 richer, Mr Saunders happily went back to the pub to continue drinking with his friends. But it wasn't until later that night that the barman, who earned a mere $700 a week, decided to try his luck again. He tried to check his account balance at another ATM but it was just registering 'balance unavailable' so he again transferred $200 and it worked before he pushed his withdrawals out to $2000, the limit of his credit card and went home. Because ATM are known to go offline at certain times, where people can transfer funds but not get a balance for their account, the money he was withdrawing was not registering. Dan Saunders (pictured) went on a wild spending spree telling people he was a poker player, a surgeon or an investment banker . From the humble life as a barman in Wangaratta, in country Victoria, Dan Saunders (pictured right) reached millionaire status and lived life to max from a technical fault in his banks ATM system . He didn't stop  there and within a couple of weeks, Saunders had  transferred $20,000. With his new found riches, rumours started to make their way around the small town and when he began punting heavily with a mate while at work one night at the pub, his luck turned. 'Turns out that we turned over more than the TAB would turn over in three weeks in one night so that alerted the TAB to the fact that we'd done that,' he told ACA. 'I told them it was friend taking the bets but they didn't want to take that on board and they got the publican to fire me as a result.' To make matters worse, rumours made their way to his girlfriend, that he was spending money all over town and she then dumped him via text message. The barman who made a mere $700 a week couldn't believed his luck when he stumbled apon the technical fault in the banking system . Dan Saunders (pictured) conned NAB bank out of thousands, then evevtually reaching $1.6 million through an ATM flaw . But instead of wallowing in his losses, he decided to go back to Melbourne, get some advice from friends and kept his bank balance, rather healthy. 'On one hand you've lost your girlfriend, lost your job, but on the other hand, hey, you've got unlimited funds. Let's smash it up for a bit let's sort things out,' he said. While he believed it was a luxury that would be short lived, Mr Saunders kept withdrawing more and more money every day and there his lifestyle as a country barman dramatically transformed into that of a millionaire. He created many different alias' to new friends, including being a poker player, a surgeon and even an investment banker, living the dream of a high roller. He then discovered another way to trick the ATM and double his money, transferring money from the ATM's 'credit' account option to his Mastercard, even though he only had one credit card. In May that year, Saunders was believed to have already stolen $1.6 million of the banks money on his credit card. But like anyone who is cheating the system, Saunders soon started felling guilty about his adventures and began to see a psychologist. After four and a half months of solid spending Dan Saunders (pictured) said guilt got the better of him and he rang the bank, but they said police were investigating and they wouldn't talk to him . Finally after three and a half years of not being caught for his wild spendings have police issued a warrant for his arrest . It was in June, four and a half months after making his costly discovery, that he stopped making continuous transfers. He told ACA he then called the bank, who told him it was under police investigation and they wouldn't talk to him. 'It was never about the actual money it was just about the journey.' Three and a half years later and Mr Saunders had still got off scot free for his dealing with ATM's, still blazay about funding his lavish lifestyle with money that wasn't his own. 'I've overdrawn my own accounts if that makes me a crook that makes me a crook,' he said. It wasn't until just last week that police issued a warrant for his arrest and continue to look for Mr Saunders, who is now suddenly missing in action.

"Father-of-three Stephen Fossey, 45, used his fruit and veg stall at Bacup market in Lancashire to illicitly lend money to up to 180 customers over four years . A market trader loan shark who boasted of interest rates  lower than Wonga and other legal payday loans firms has been ordered to pay back more than £100,000. Stephen Fossey, 45, used his fruit and veg stall  at Bacup market in Lancashire to illicitly lend money to up to 180 customers over a four year period. He typically charged between 25 and 30 per cent, which gives an annual rate of 1,355 per cent in comparison to legal online credit firms who have been known to charge up to 4,000 per cent annual interest on repayments. Fossey, from Rossendale, Lancashire, was caught after investigators from the England Illegal Money Lending Team were tipped off by trading standards officers who were investigating a black market tobacco racket he was running. It emerged the father of three had made a total of £325,473 over a period of four and a half years through the illegal money lending business so he could save up for pension. His assets included three properties in the Lancashire area, bank balances and cash seized at the time of his arrest. He has since been expelled from Bacup market. Last year, Fossey admitted engaging in a money lending operation, without a licence under the Consumer Credit Act, and two allegations of possessing criminal property. He was given a 12 month suspended prison term after a judge said customers 'spoke highly' of Fossey and revealed they were not frightened of him. However, yesterday he was hauled before Preston Crown Court and under Proceeds of Crime laws was ordered to back £103,000 within six months or face 21 months in prison. Earlier, the court heard Fossey - who has also operated a mobile greengrocer's shop for 25 years - had run his loan sharking enterprise between 2008 and 2012. He agreed to lend money to customers while conducting his fruit and veg rounds in Burnley and Rossendale and nearby Todmorden. During the investigation, 40 victims of the illegal business were traced who were able to verify that he had been offering loans, charging interest and offering no paperwork. Many of the victims confirmed that he had continued to lend even after he had been warned. Interest was added sporadically, but tended to vary between 25 and 30 per cent on top of the original loan. Some victims paid up to £200 on top of a £500 loan, and more than £1000 was added on to a loan of £3500. One victim spoke of how he had been repaying the loan for more than 10 years and believed he had paid back thousands of pounds. When he was struggling to repay, he was forced to take out further loans to pay off existing ones. At the point of Fossey's arrest, he was paying up to £130 a week and was told he still owed £2,500. The father of three was caught after officers were tipped off about his fruit and veg stall at Bacup market . Fossey, of Rossendale, Lancashire, arrived at Preston Crown Court with friends and family for the hearing in which he was ordered to pay back £103,000 within the next six months or face a prison sentence of 21 months . During a raid of Fossey’s home, Trading Standards officers found a carrier bag under his bed containing two bags of money, totalling £7,164, and documentation, in particular two notebooks, an address book and a black pad. Also seized was a hand- written letter addressed to 'Steve' and 'Phil' from one of those who had borrowed money. The notebooks were effectively records of loans Fossey had provided over the previous 13 months. Over that period alone there had been 196 loan accounts between the defendant and borrowers. Over 100 people had an account, some had more than one and 449 loans had been issued, including top-ups. The outstanding balance owed to Fossey was £93,918. At an earlier hearing, Fossey's defence lawyer Mark Stuart said: 'There is no suggestion any sort of pressure was put upon people to repay. 'He was charging far less a rate of interest than those of licensed money lenders. This was going to be a pot for him, having had no pension for his retirement. He has now lost £100,000 that was owed to him.' But Janice Hanson, Lancashire County Council cabinet member for public protection services, said: 'Illegal money lenders cause misery for some of our most vulnerable people and this case sends a clear warning that they will be pursued and prosecuted, and their assets seized. 'We will continue to work closely with the Illegal Money Lending Team and the police to protect people from loan sharks. 'If you or someone you know is in difficulty with a loan shark the best way to get help is to let us know what's happening by calling the confidential hotline.'"

"(CNN) -- Facebook unveiled changes to its terms-of-use document on Friday, tweaking earlier drafts in an apparent effort to ease users' concerns about privacy and how their information is used. The proposed changes to the networking giant's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities come after the plan was opened up for user comments last month, and just weeks before Facebook is expected to go public in a stock offering some expect could value the company at $100 billion. Front and center in the announcement was an effort to explain that the way Facebook collects and shares data is not being changed. ""Some of our users and a number of journalists mistook the proposed update to our SRR for changes to the way we collect or use data,"" Facebook said in a post on the site. ""Our Data Use Policy (which used to be called our privacy policy) governs how we collect and use data. We are not proposing any updates to that document at this time."" Little has slowed Facebook's ascent to the top of the social-media world. What began as a dorm-room project for Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard classmates grew into a phenomenon that has amassed more than 800 million active users. But if Facebook has had an Achilles heel, it's been concerns about how user data is used. Because it's a free service, Facebook depends on targeted advertising and a cut of the micro-payments users make in games and other apps running on the site. Users' activity on the site is used to paint a picture of them, and shared by Facebook to help those advertisers pick their targets. Web privacy advocates, including some government officials in the United States and elsewhere, have repeatedly expressed unease with the sheer amount of data Facebook possesses about its users and how that data may be used. It's obvious that the company wants to tamp down user concerns about that in advance of its arrival on Wall Street. In its filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the word ""privacy"" was used 35 times. That document, which is required for companies filing to go public, was obviously largely positive about Facebook's upside. But when required to acknowledge potential downsides, Facebook wrote that if users ever widely became concerned about their privacy and use of their data, they could lose some of them. Facebook writes that it must avoid adopting ""policies or procedures related to areas such as sharing or user data that are perceived negatively by our users or the general public."" CNNMoney: Facebook strips 'privacy' from new 'data use' policy explainer . In a set of bulleted posts Friday, Facebook outlined the tweaks it has made in response to user feedback and explained items it says raised concerns. -- In a change first noted last month, the document now uses the term ""Data Use Policy"" instead of ""Privacy Policy."" Facebook says this reflects a change that was made last year because they ""believe the name is more descriptive of the information the document provides."" -- Language that said ""you or other that can see your content and information"" was removed for a different definition of how and when apps can access data about your friends. It adds links to more information and how users can control that. -- Facebook also clarified language saying that people should not ""tag users if you know they do not wish to be tagged"" in photos. That passage doesn't change how tagging works, but is merely meant to be a guideline, the company said. -- The changes remove a line saying that Facebook reserves the right to deny or limit access to users outside the United States. The site says that line was unclear and meant to reflect places where services are legally unavailable, or places where Facebook is banned. The document also included a not-so-subtle swipe at one of Facebook's chief competitors. ""Unlike other Internet companies, we propose updates to our SRR and give our users an opportunity to comment before they go into effect,"" Friday's announcement said."" Your insights and perspectives are really valuable to us, enabling us to respond to your questions and make substantive changes to address your concerns before changes are implemented."" Earlier this year, Google (which has launched social platform Google+ as a Facebook rival) rolled out significant changes to its privacy policy. While Google went out of its way to publicize the changes to users, feedback was not as aggressively sought and did not appear, at least publicly, to lead to any major changes. Facebook users can comment on the latest round of proposed changes until April 27, the post said."
"A remarkable summer for Caroline Wozniacki continued with yet more drama on Friday night when she was ushered through to the US Open final when her opponent was struck by full body cramps. The 24 year-old Dane was leading Shuai Peng 7-6, 4-3 when the Chinese player started flexing her leg before becoming unable to walk with severe pain in her legs. There then followed first an off court medical evaluation, and then a full injury time out, as she was treated for what amounts to a loss of physical condition. VIDEO Scroll down for  great footage of Caroline Wozniacki including her ice bucket challenge and a day at the beach with Serena Williams . Agony: Shuai Peng is taken off the court by wheelchair after retiring from women's singles semi-final . Distraught: Shuai Peng has struggled breathing after collapsing twice on court during US Open semi-final . Concern: Shuai Peng of China is taken off the court by wheelchair . Despite this the rules allowed her to carry on after a ten minute hiatus without any penalty, but four points later Peng crumpled into a heap on court and went into major spasms in her upper body, upon which there was no option but to retire. A complete re-examination of the regulations can wait for another day as it was, ultimately, unfair on Wozniacki, but the main focus was on the health of Peng, who had to be pushed off in a wheelchair with a doctor in attendance, leaving Wozniacki to understandably muted celebrations of a huge achievement in reaching her second US Open final, where she will face world No 1 Serena Williams. She said: 'It was really hard to watch for me whenever I saw her collapse on the court. Tennis is great, but health is more important. 'To see her struggling out there, I just wanted to make sure she was okay. I got the word that she's okay now and just getting cooled down, so that's great to hear. 'I know that she had heart surgery when she was 13, so that's definitely something that I think she was worried about, as well.' Pain: Peng crumpled into a heap on court and went into major spasms . Distress: Shuai Peng of China is attended by medical staff after she slumped to the court . Concern: Caroline Wozniacki checks on Shuai Peng after she collapsed on court . Tournament director David Brewer confirmed Peng had recovered well enough to return to the locker room and that the doctor, player and trainer all agreed it would not be physically harmful to her to try to play on. Wozniacki had her own fitness concerns having been in bed with a cold for the previous two days but said she would 'come out firing' on Sunday. The Dane was 19 and rocketing to the top of the game when she last reached the final, and it has been a bumpy road to get back. 'I have goose bumps right now,' she said. 'It's been five years since I've been in the final here so it's incredible to be back.' And so the three months of her life that have unfolded in a way that Wozniacki could never have envisaged may end in extraordinary fashion with her winning the first Grand Slam of her career. Humidity: Caroline Wozniacki applies an ice pack to her face during a break between games . Struggle: Wozniacki feels the heat during semi-final against Peng Shuai . From the slough of despond she fell into after Rory McIlroy broke off their engagement in May she has risen magnificently, all the way to the opportunity for a massive career breakthrough. Wozniacki arrived in it via a hard fought progression which, before the medical issues arose, was, in keeping with her life of late, much harder than expected. The 24 year-old Dane is searching for the first Grand Slam as a professional, despite having twice ended a season as the world No 1 through her overall consistency. It was five years ago at Flushing Meadows that she made the final, and there appeared absolutely no prospect of that occurring again back in May, when her personal life was sedate but her on court fortunes seriously on the wane. As her former fiancée prepared to tee off in Denver Wozniacki walked out onto the Arthur Ashe Stadium in steaming temperatures accompanied by a brisk wind that will have contributed to Peng's eventual demise. In 37 Grand Slams the 28 year-old Chinese had never reached a semi-final, and prior to this was much better known for her prowess in doubles, which sees her ranked as the world's No 3 player. Power: The 24 year-old Dane was leading Shuai Peng 7-6 4-3 when her opponent retired . Target: Wozniacki has the chance to secure her first Grand Slam title . Yet her surge in form while flying solo had been such that in five matches she had not dropped a set, and had only conceded three service games, even fewer than the likes of Williams. From the start her flatly hit groundstrokes caused the Dane problems, while the wind was causing trouble with her serve, leading to five double faults in all during the first set. Twice Wozniacki needed to come back from a break down before romping through the tiebreak 7-1 after Peng had served for it at 6-5. The second set was also hard fought, and even in her brief return from treatment Peng managed to force a break point to get back to 4-4 before bowing the inevitable, given her rapidly deteriorating physical state. The incident will be accompanied by calls for more changes to procedures on the WTA Tour, after a similar incident at the Australian Open involving Victoria Azarenka against Sloane Stephens."
"Aston Villa look set for a third consecutive Premier League relegation battle this season and supporters are beginning to turn on manager Paul Lambert and owner Randy Lerner. The Midlands club are currently 13th in the league just three points clear of the dreaded drop-zone and Villa have only scored 11 goals from 21 games this season. Supporters have proposed a large-scale protest in the Holte End of Villa Park ahead of the visit of Liverpool urging fans to leave their seat vacant for the first eight minutes, the number of years Lerner has been in charge of the club. David Michael of Aston Villa blog MyOldManSaid.com says supporters want their club back. Aston Villa supporters are losing patience with manager Paul Lambert and owner Randy Lerner . There’s a saying among Villa fans, that you don’t chose Aston Villa, it chooses you. At the moment though, supporting the club feels like having to serve a sentence  for a crime you didn’t commit. Since Martin O’Neill stormed out of the club after having drained chairman Randy Lerner’s resources in a bid to reach the honeypot of the Champions League, Villa have been in free fall. O’Neill ultimately failed, Lerner wasn’t impressed and Villa supporters simply suffered. Current boss Paul Lambert said after Villa’s last game, when responding to questions about agitated supporters calling for his head, that ‘the expectancy levels outweigh the realism’. Lambert knows, though, considering his 41 and 38-point season finishes and the unwanted records he’s collected, including having the worst Premier League record of any Villa manager, one thing fans have been is patient with him. Aston Villa were beaten 1-0 by Premier League strugglers Leicester last weekend . Sections of the Villa crowd called for Lambert to be sacked during the defeat to Nigel Pearson's side . I’ve lost count of the number of managers local rivals West Brom have fired during Lambert’s time at Villa Park. Even in the face of constant humiliation (losing to Bradford City in a semi-final, being beaten 8-0 by Chelsea, suffering a record 10 home league defeats in a season, and losing six games in a row this season), we’ve always hoped Lambert could turn it around. But he hasn’t. With 11 goals in 21 league games our ‘expectancy levels’ have now dropped to praying for shots on target and maybe seeing a Villa goal some day. It’s sad. Certainly in my lifetime, Villa have traditionally been considered a top-half team with ambitions of European football. I’ve personally seen them win everything bar the FA Cup. Yet, as the club enters its fifth consecutive relegation battle, fans' ambition has been dumbed down to Premier League survival. Tempers flared on the pitch after a bad challenge by Leicester's Matthew James led to a red card . Relegation shouldn’t even be in an Aston Villa supporter’s vernacular, and you have to feel sorry for the younger generation of Villa fans who have experienced nothing but the bland decay of their beloved club. The overriding problem is a lack of strategic consistency. There was a change in transfer policy from young and hungry (and cheap) to low-cost journeymen, an astonishing U-turn on the exiled ‘bomb squad’ players. While on the pitch, Lambert, recently switched to the same possession-based ethos he abandoned during his first season in charge. The latest edition, again offers a chronic lack of cutting edge in the final third, but hopefully the signing of Carles Gil will remedy that and make the increasingly disillusioned Christian Benteke a threat once again. Aston Villa have signed midfielder Carles Gil from Valencia for £3.25millon . Lambert attends press conference with his new signing, who he will hope can add a creative spark . Off the pitch, the last we heard directly from our chairman was a statement in May last year, saying he was selling the club. He told us: ‘I owe it to Villa to move on, and look for fresh, invigorated leadership, if in my heart I feel I can no longer do the job.’ He’s still the chairman, yet we haven’t heard from him since, although we are often reminded by Lambert that Lerner owns a telephone and television, so he knows what is happening at the club. But do you know he gave the Villa boss a new four-year contract, a mere four games after he ended the previous season with relegation form of 38 points? It’s baffling. Villa have only managed to scored 11 goals from 21 league games this season . The new Villa CEO Tom Fox talks about the club’s future being in Europe, but increasingly-worried supporters feel it’s more likely to be in the Championship. After all, we’ve heard the Europe line before from Fox’s predecessor. The proposed supporter demonstration of vacating the Holte End  for the first eight minutes of the game against Liverpool is simply saying ‘enough is enough’. This compromised version of Aston Villa can’t continue. We want to be confident of what the custodians of our club are doing. We want clarity. We want ambition. And most of all, we want our Villa back. Twitter: @oldmansaid ."
"Halle, Belgium (CNN) -- At least 18 people died and 162 were hurt when two trains collided in Halle on Monday, a government spokeswoman said. The trains collided head-on at 8:30 a.m., the companies that run the Belgian railways and the train said. The cause of the accident is not known, according to the railway operator, Infrabel, and SNCB, the train operator. Authorities do not believe there is anyone else on the trains, said Anya De Wols, spokeswoman for the province of Flemish Brabant. But they have not ruled out the possibility bodies could be pinned beneath the train cars, she said, and they plan to lift the cars from the track by Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, investigators will collect personal effects, such as wallets, from the scene to help identify the victims, she said. Send your pictures, videos, stories . A Belgian government spokesman, Bart Ouvry, said it was snowing at the time of the crash, but not an unusual amount. People were thrown against the walls of the trains by the impact, said Emily Divinagracia, whose husband, Stephan Riviere, was a passenger. He was awakened by the impact, she said he told her by phone minutes after the accident. It took about 30 minutes for rescue crews to arrive, and some passengers did not immediately know there had been a collision, she said. ""He was actually getting the news from me, because they didn't know much on their side and it was all a bit disorganized, obviously, because nobody expected this sort of thing to happen,"" she said. Riviere was not badly injured, his wife said. The injured were being treated at a sports center near the scene of the accident, the Belga news agency reported. Fifty-five of them were taken to hospitals, while more than a hundred others had minor injuries, De Wols said. The crash took place during morning rush hour when people were on their way to work, Belga journalist Eric Vidal said from the scene. Pictures showed people being taken from the crash site by stretcher as snow fell. Passengers who were not hurt in the crash were taken away by bus, according to Vidal. He said people had come to the station to try to find family members who may have been involved in the crash. Belgian Prime Minister Yves Leterme is on his way back from Kosovo, Albania, and would visit the scene of the crash, his office said. The Justice Ministry is in charge of the investigation, Leterme's office added. The crash caused disruption to parts of the wider rail network in northern Europe. Eurostar suspended high-speed train services between London, England, and Brussels, Belgium, the company announced, and did not expect the trains to run for the rest of the day. London-to-Paris services were not affected, the company said, but there were delays on the service to Lille in northern France close to the border with Belgium. Thalys, which operates high-speed trains across much of northern Europe, announced that services were fully suspended all day, affecting travel to Brussels from Paris, France; Amsterdam, Netherlands; and Cologne, Germany. The company urged passengers planning to travel this week to check its Web site, www.thalys.com, before starting their trips. The French high-speed train operator TGV Europe announced that its Brussels-bound services were going only as far as Lille. Eight people died in a train crash in Belgium in March 2001, media reports said at the time, calling it the worst rail accident in the country in 25 years. Investigators later suggested the two trains collided because of confusion between a French-speaking signalman and a Flemish-speaking one. Belgium is divided between speakers of the two languages. Monday's crash is one of the deadliest train accidents in Europe since at least 41 people were killed in the Balkan nation of Montenegro in 2006. At least 180 passengers also were injured when a train derailed and plunged down an embankment outside the capital, Podgorica.

"By . Tim Shipman . Praise: Which? has sided with pensions experts and campaigners for the elderly to back George Osborne's reforms . Britain’s consumer watchdog Which? has joined up with Saga and pension experts to praise George Osborne’s people power reforms, saying they will ‘transform the way people of all ages save for their future’. In a rare intervention into the political arena, the consumer champion claimed the measures will introduce ‘genuine flexibility and choice for millions of people planning for their retirement’. Some Labour politicians have suggested that pensioners could not be trusted to spend their money wisely. However Which? has come together with over-50s group Saga as well as Aegon – one of the UK’s largest insurers – and the country’s most prominent pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann to praise the ‘landmark reforms’. In a letter to the Daily Mail, the experts say Mr Osborne’s decision that retirees should no longer have to buy an annuity have their ‘wholehearted support’ because they mean treating people ‘like grown-ups’. And they pointedly back the Chancellor’s call for people to spend their pension pot as they wish. The endorsement is significant as it is rare for Which? to take sides in a political battle. The letter has been signed by Which? chief executive Peter Vicary-Smith, Adrian Grace the boss of Aegon, Andrew Goodsell of Saga and Dr Altmann. In an attack on the Labour politicians who claimed people would waste their money, the experts wrote: ‘Some say people can’t be trusted to make decisions about how to invest their pensions savings. We disagree. ‘It is good that people who have saved all their lives will now be able to choose for themselves how to access their pension and whether or not to buy an annuity.’ The letter contradicts claims by the Institute for Fiscal Studies that the changes will make annuities – for those who do choose to buy them – worth even less in future. Support: Dr Ross Altmann, the country's foremost pensions expert, also signed the letter . ‘Ending the captive market for annuities will be good for competition, and spur the pensions industry to provide more products and better value,’ the experts insisted, adding: ‘It’s good to see the Government encouraging saving and treating people like grown-ups.’ Dr Altmann also praised the Mail for campaigning to help savers, saying: ‘I do believe the Mail made an enormous difference.’ Last night George Osborne thanked the group for their unusual intervention, saying: ‘This impressive letter confirms that the pensions reforms in my Budget have struck a chord. I’m grateful for the very positive response from the consumer groups and savings industry.’ And David Cameron taunted Labour for its uncertain response to the reforms, branding Ed Miliband’s team ‘all over the place’. The Prime Minister said: ‘While Labour dither and flail around for ideas, we have made long-term changes that will give millions greater security in old age. ‘This is about backing those who work hard, save and do the right thing. And it’s about saying that the best people to look after their money are those who earned it in the first place.’ Labour MPs demanded that Ed Miliband beef up his economic policies last night after his ‘lame’ response to the Budget gave the Tories a poll bounce. And in further dispiriting news for the Labour chief, a survey revealed that voters think he is the ‘weirdest’ party leader in Britain. The YouGov poll for BuzzFeed showed that 41 per cent think Mr Miliband is either ‘very weird’ or ‘somewhat weird’, while 34 per cent thinks the same of Nick Clegg and only 27 per cent believe that David Cameron is weird. Lame response: Ed Miliband has faced criticism for his response to the Budget . The survey, which looked at the public’s perception of the leaders’ personalities, also found 36 per cent of the population believe Mr Miliband would have been bullied at school, a third think he would have been an unpopular student and 57 per cent said he would have been the hardest-working pupil. But the more pressing concern for Labour MPs is that another YouGov opinion poll put the Tories on 36 points, just one point behind Labour, while a Survation poll had the Conservatives on 34 points – also only one point behind. And Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls were still trailing far behind the Conservatives when voters were asked which party they trust to run the economy. A senior Labour frontbencher said: ‘Our economic offering was already seen as weak by some voters. Ed’s lame response has not helped with that. ‘Some people seem to think that we can just coast to victory. This poll should be a wake-up call.’"
"St Helens want to let the RFL deal with disgraced Wigan prop Ben Flower after he punched Lance Hohaia in Saturday’s Grand Final and are unlikely to call for a criminal investigation. Flower was sent off for landing two blows on Hohaia, the second while his opponent lay motionless on the ground at Old Trafford. The 26-year-old has been charged with a Grade F offence, the most serious in the RFL’s disciplinary code, and will appear before a three-man panel on Tuesday. Wigan prop Ben Flower knocked St Helens stand-off Lance Hohaia to the ground just two minutes in . Wales international Flower then followed up by landing a right hook on the stricken Hohaia . Flower has been charged with Grade F offence, meaning he could get a minimum ban of eight matches . Refeere Phil Bentham shows red card to Wigan prop Flower during Saturday's Grand Final . Grade A Offence - Fine/less than one week . Grade B Offence - One-two weeks . Grace C Offence - Two-three weeks . Grade D Offence - Three-five weeks . Grade E Offence - Four-eight weeks . Grade F Offence - Eight weeks plus, or a specified period of suspension . Flower, who has apologised for the incident, faces a minimum eight-match ban but there are calls for a longer suspension. Saints also have the option of pursuing their own action and held talks with Greater Manchester Police on Monday. However, it is understood the Grand Final winners are reluctant to do so if they are satisfied with the RFL punishment. Saints chief executive Mike Rush said: ‘We’ll wait for the league to take the appropriate steps before passing comment and will then consider our position.’ There are concerns within the game that involving the police would set a dangerous precedent. Former Wales dual-code international Jonathan Davies said: ‘It opens up a can of worms if the police get involved because then you could have cases like this in any sport, from any age.’ Hohaia has been charged with a Grade B offence for allegedly striking Flower in the face with his forearm, which carries a ban of one to two games. St Helens went on to celebrate a famous victory at Old Trafford after seeing off 12-man Wigan ."
"By . Helen Collis . PUBLISHED: . 09:12 EST, 2 June 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 09:13 EST, 2 June 2012 . A tenant has been sentenced to 10 years after being found guilty of stabbing his housemate to death in an argument over a blocked toilet. James Biddinger, 27, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter in March over the fatal stabbing of 22-year-old Kevin Mbayo in a townhouse in Germantown, Maryland in the US, in May 2011. The property was home to several people who rented rooms, however Mbayo was not a tenant, but he had been living with his father Ernest Mbayo who rented a room at the address, according to the New York Post and myfoxny.com . James Biddinger, pictured, was found guilty of voluntary manslaughter over the fatal stabbing of Kevin Mbayo, 22, in a house in Germantown, Maryland . During the trial, the court heard how Biddinger's seething resentment towards Mbayo became all-encompassing. The 27-year-old was allegedly unhappy that Mbayo had lived at the townhouse without paying rent, and had been using a communal sofa in the home, the New York Post said. On the night of the attack, Biddinger discovered that a toilet in the property had been clogged and blamed Mbayo for it. In the violent confrontation that ensued, he stabbed the younger man. In sentencing on Friday, Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge, Robert A. Greenberg, outlined his reasons for exceeding recommended punishment guidelines under Maryland law. Greenberg said, according to the press reports, that Biddinger had brought a knife to confront Mbayo, fled the scene after the attack and had shed 'crocodile tears' when he was later told of Mbayo's death. Biddinger had also attempted to persuade eyewitnesses against testifying, Greenberg said. 'Fortunately, you didn't succeed,' the judge added. Biddinger, who has been in jail since his arrest in May 2011, will be eligible for parole after five years. During the trial, the court heard how third housemate, Miles Edward Willis had heard the fight from his room, beneath the lounge. He said he heard a loud thud, as if someone had fallen to the floor, according to gazette.net, from a March report on the trial. Willis also found one of his kitchen knives with blood on it hidden on the kitchen counter six days after the fight, he testified. Willis said he found the knife between a cereal box and the kitchen wall; he called police immediately to submit it as possible evidence. Attorneys said in opening arguments Monday that Biddinger had taken the knife used in the stabbing with him when he left the house, throwing it out the car window as his friend drove him to the Wal-Mart before cooperating with police to locate the weapon that night."
"By . Ruth Styles . Dressed in a black bra and thong, Charley, 18, from Edinburgh, gyrates her way through a crowd of men, many drunk and leering. But this is one stripper who doesn't live up to the stereotype. Charley spends her evenings taking her clothes off to pay for a degree in sports science - her passport, she hopes, to a better life. 'Stripping is just an escape from everything,' she explains. 'I go in there and I'm a completely different person.' Scroll down for video . Big plans: Charley is using the proceeds of her stripping career to help fund herself through university . Charley, who grew up in one of the less salubrious parts of Edinburgh, adds: 'A . lot of people that I grew up with don't really care and just skive. 'I'm . totally the opposite. Because the place I live in isn't a very good . area, I want to be better and do my family proud. To do that, I am a . stripper.' With universities charging £9,000 a year or more in tuition fees, she's far from being the only student to turn to sex work to survive. A recent study published by the British Journal of Sociology of Education found that as many as one in three strippers are students and blamed the figure on the increasing costs of tuition fees. And it's not just strip clubs that have benefited from students who turn to sex work to pay their fees. Others fund their studies by turning to sugar daddy websites such as Sponsor A Scholar, where girls are paid up to £15,000 a year in exchange for 'companionship'. Determined: Charley says she will do whatever it takes to overcome her deprived upbringing . 'A . lot of people that I grew up with don't really care and just skive. I'm . totally the opposite. Because the place I live in isn't a very good . area, I want to be better and do my family proud. To do that, I am a . stripper.' Experts have also claimed that one of the reasons for the increase in student sex workers is that the work is becoming more socially acceptable. Speaking to the Times Higher Education magazine, sociologist Teela Sanders said that some student strippers saw themselves as 'dancers, not sex workers' because 'selling striptease had become more palatable and socially acceptable.' For Charley, who still lives at home with her father, stripping is the first job she's ever had and she admits she was thrilled when she was told she'd got it. 'I applied for a lot of jobs before and I . kept getting knocked back because I had no experience,' she explains. 'I have no idea . how I had the confidence to walk in here... It's crazy. It just sort of . happened really quickly. 'I was so excited afterwards. I was thinking . ""I'm 18 and I've got a job!"" I went and had icecream afterwards to celebrate.' She now spends six nights a week working at Baby Dolls, one of three strip clubs that make up Edinburgh's 'Pubic Triangle'. It's not always easy, although Charley, who makes around £100 a night, says the work has given her extra confidence. 'When I was at school, the boys found some girls . attractive but not once did they look at me,' she remembers. Different world: Charley is just 18-years-old and says stripping is the first and only job she's ever had . Relationship: Charley won't allow her boyfriend Connor to see her at work for fear of hurting him . 'They [the other girls] were all really skinny . with nice clothes, and nice hair, and I was a bit chubby. I got into . dancing to prove that I can be . beautiful, I can be sexy. She adds: 'A year ago, I couldn't get on buses without being . really anxious. I feel better about myself, even though dancing maybe . isn't the prettiest job in the world and I know some people would say it's sleazy. 'I walk out with my head held high and it's empowering.' Boyfriend Connor doesn't share her enthusiasm however and says he worries about Charley's safety when she's at work. 'I think [strip clubs] can be seedy places and I'm . worried for her wellbeing,' he reveals. 'I think I might get a bit jealous if I was . to see her doing sexy provocative stuff... I think ""that's just for me!"" but at the end of the day, I know it's just her job.' New life: Charley hopes to one day swap stripping for a job as a police woman after college . Charley herself has imposed a set of strict rules on Connor and refuses to let him go to the club where she works. 'I don't want him to see me doing this,' she admits. 'I . think it would hurt him too much. He just means too much to me for me . to do that to him.' Ultimately, for Charley, stripping, however distasteful, is a means to an end and a route out of the grim estate where she grew up and still lives. 'I really hate where I live,' she admits. 'It's a horrible, . horrible place. I wouldn't bring my children up here and I kind of hate that I . was brought up here.' Her goal, she says, is to use her sports science degree to become a policewoman. 'I like that you get to be a strong independent woman,' she smiles. 'I like the idea of helping the public and dealing with tough situations.' She's certainly no stranger to the latter. Charley appears on Strippers, tonight at 10pm on Channel 4 ."
"(CNN) -- Two international bridges between Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and Laredo, Texas, were closed Wednesday because of rising water on the Rio Grande, Laredo officials said. Laredo's International Bridge I is one of four that connect the two cities, but because it has the lowest elevation it was closed, said Laredo spokeswoman Xochitl Mora Garcia. Officials are worried that the high water may damage the bridge and are removing steel canopy shades authorities believe add weight and stress to the span, the spokeswoman told CNN. Officials expect the bridge to be closed for at least three days, Mora Garcia said. The Rio Grande, which usually has a depth of 6 to 10 feet at Laredo, is expected to crest Thursday at nearly 39 feet, the spokeswoman said. A second crossing, the Colombia Bridge, was closed because the water is cresting there at a higher level, Mora Garcia said. The bridge will be closed until further notice. It will take about a day to remove the canopies at International Bridge I and another day to reinstall them after the high waters subside, Mora Garcia said. About 10,000 to 12,000 pedestrians and 12,000 to 14,000 noncommercial vehicles cross International Bridge I each day, Mora Garcia said. Laredo has a population of about 250,000, but that typically swells to 350,000 to 400,000 as Mexicans come to the city to shop, visit family or engage in recreational activities, the spokeswoman said. The city is the nation's No. 1 inland port, Mora Garcia said. International Bridge II and the World Trade Bridge will remain open. Laredo owns and operates the four bridges, Mora Garcia said. ""Pedestrians who have no other alternative to reach Nuevo Laredo are encouraged to return immediately or make arrangements to travel by vehicle by Bridge II,"" the city said in a news release. ""Bridge II will NOT accept pedestrians to return to Nuevo Laredo. Colombia Bridge and World Trade Bridge can accept pedestrians."" In addition, buses from Nuevo Laredo will be transporting would-be pedestrians back and forth over Bridge II over the vehicle-only bridge. The arrangement was made between U.S. and Mexican officials and will remain in effect for the duration of the emergency situation, Mora Garcia said. Laredo was planning to open its emergency operation center Wednesday afternoon. Residents in the 100-year floodplain will be notified to evacuate if necessary, officials said. The Laredo Civic Center can be converted into a shelter, the city said. On Wednesday, Texas Gov. Rick Perry announced that he was sending vehicles, guardsmen, and rescue divers to the Laredo area. ""As South Texas continues to feel the effects of Hurricane Alex, we are closely monitoring a storm system that is expected to bring more heavy rains to the area and increase flooding along the Rio Grande,"" Perry said. Water service in Laredo will not be affected, but residents in Nuevo Laredo may have water service at 50 percent of the city's operating capacity, Laredo officials said. Communities throughout northeastern Mexico have been flooded as a result of heavy rains spawned by Hurricane Alex nearly two weeks ago. In the city of Reynosa in Tamaulipas state, on the border with Texas, 23,000 people were in danger Wednesday because of flooding by the Rio Bravo, the government-run Notimex news agency said. Alex stormed onshore as a Category 2 Hurricane on June 30, causing at least six deaths in Nuevo Leon state."
"BMW is recalling 91,800 Mini Coopers to fix a defect that may prevent the air bag on the front passenger side of the cars from deploying in a crash. The problem affects the 2005 to 2008 models of the Mini Cooper and Cooper S. BMW says the air bag may not work properly because of a error that might prevent the vehicles' mat detection system from sensing a passenger sitting in the front seat during a severe crash. BMW has announced that  2005 to 2008 models of the Mini Cooper and Cooper S will need to be recalled due to problems with the passenger detection system that could leave those in the car without an airbad . BMW told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that it has been notified of one minor injury linked to the defect. To repair the problem, BMW will replace the detection mats in the affected models for free. The recall of the mats, which are manufactured in Germany, will begin May 1. There are 59,270 Mini Cooper and Cooper S models made between 2005 and 2006 affected by the issue along with 32,530  convertibles made between 2005 and July 2008, according to Bloomberg. Only one person has been injured so far as a result of the passenger seat (right) defect. The problem is thought to affect ten per cent of the 2005 and 2006 regular and 2005 to 2008 convertible models being recalled . Vehicle owners can get further information at 1-888-327-4236 or http://www.safercar.gov. BMW estimates that ten per cent of the cars being recalled actually have the detection mat problem. According to Motortrend, the current recalls is not the first such major incident for Mini Coopers in recent years. More than  90,000 cars made from 2006 to 2011 were also recalled in 2012 because of circuit board problems that could start vehicle fires."
"Laurel, Maryland (CNN) -- On a late afternoon in early June, undercover police officers circled a one-story highway motel north of Washington. Inside was a 12-year-old girl who told her mother she was being forced to work as a prostitute. According to her mother, the girl had started running away from home earlier this year. She found out her daughter was in the sex trade when she saw her in an adult online classified ad. The girl was advertising herself as a 24-year-old with a bogus name. The next time she ran away, her mother reported her missing. Read the police press release . According to police and anti-trafficking advocates, the internet has now become the preferred way to sell women for sex. It's fast and convenient for the pimps and relatively safe for the men who pay for sex. Instead of trolling the streets, they can now look through hundreds of girls from the safety of their homes or hotels. This time, the girl was lucky. She called home, and the call was traced to a Knight's Inn in Laurel, Maryland, where police were quickly on the scene. They rescued the girl and arrested a 42-year-old man and charged him with human trafficking. Of all the sites that offer ""adult services,"" Craigslist is one of the most popular. The online classified ad site is used regularly by about 50 million Americans for everything from buying used lawn furniture to finding a job or a roommate. It's also used to sell sex, making Craigslist a prime target of a nationwide campaign against internet prostitution. ""Most of the young women we've worked with who have been exploited online talk about Craigslist,"" said Andrea Powell of the anti-trafficking group The FAIR Fund. ""Craigslist is like the Wal-Mart of online sex trafficking right now in this country."" According to police who investigated the case of the missing 12-year-old, she had previously advertised on Craigslist under a false name and age. Craigslist declined to provide copies of the ad, citing privacy concerns. Craigslist founder Craig Newmark defended his site, saying it is doing more than any other site that hosts adult ads to help filter out underage prostitutes and report them to police. In 2008, under pressure from state prosecutors, the website raised the fees for posting adult services ads. In 2009, it started donating portions of the money generated by adult ads to charity. Craigslist also began to manually screen all ads and said it would refer any suspected underage girls to law enforcement. That's not good enough for anti-trafficking activists. For all its reforms, they say Craigslist still has no way of knowing whether the females being sold are women or girls and is doing too little to help police identify and rescue children who are being sold for sex. A CNN investigation of Craigslist's ""adult services"" section, which replaced ""erotic services ads"" two years ago, counted more than 7,000 ads in a single day. Many offered thinly veiled ""services"" for anything from $50 for a half hour to $400 an hour. Many of the ads had photographs attached, and in many of those it was difficult to tell whether the female was an adult or a minor. Ads with words suggestive of youth, like ""young"" and ""fresh,"" received a flood of responses from men who clearly expected sex in exchange for money. One 20-year-old said it's the easiest and cheapest way to get customers. A 20-year-old identified only as ""Jessica"" works out of low-rent hotels on Washington's busy Interstate 95 corridor. She posts ads mid-morning for $10 and says she earns up to $250 from each man who answers and shows up. She told CNN her ""man"" -- her pimp -- was good to her, but that the vast majority of the females who post ads are run by pimps who force them to have sex with as many as a dozen men a day. She said many of the prostitutes give everything they earn directly to the pimps. If they don't, they're beaten. ""Girls are called 'yes bitches' and 'no bitches.' Yes bitches are what the pimps want,"" Jessica said after applying makeup to cover bruising on her face. ""My advice is if you're doing this to be a yes bitch. Otherwise, you're going to have a very hard time."" Just how many of the ads include children is extremely difficult to establish, but many of the photos that accompany the ads on Craigslist are questionable. A classified posted alongside Jessica's ad in the Washington market showed an African-American woman in her underwear offering herself for $250 an hour. Like dozens of other pictures posted the same week, her face appeared very young. According to internet research firm the AIM Group, Craigslist this year is expected to earn a third of its revenue -- more than $36 million -- from its adult services section alone. AIM Group's summary report on Craigslist . Craigslist says any increased revenue is partly because it was required to charge more for adult ads under a 2008 agreement with government officials intended to curb the volume of online adult ads. But the amount it is earning has opened the website up to charges that it's profiting from the exploitation of women. According to its own rules, Craigslist requires anyone using its adult services section to immediately report any suspicious ads to a national tip-line run by the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. The head of Washington's Metropolitan Police anti-prostitution unit said Craigslist ""never"" reports suspicious ads to his department. ""It does bother us from a law enforcement perspective, because the problem is so rampant that you know to get a handle on it we need all the assistance we can get,"" Metropolitan police inspector Brian Bray said. ""If they're notifying, I'm not sure if they're notifying the right people, because we're not getting a call."" Craigslist spokeswoman Susan MacTavish told CNN in an e-mail that of all the websites that offer adult services ads, Craigslist is the leader in pushing users to report any suspected violation. She said the site cooperates fully with law enforcement, and that fewer than one ad in 10,000 meets the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's guidelines for anti-trafficking action. MacTavish also noted that Craigslist requires anyone posting an ad to give the website a phone number, which is verified as being real. She said that because Craigslist follows the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's guidelines, the percentage of ads in its adult services section that are in fact children is ""effectively zero."" The head of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children said his group has recently started to get referrals from Craigslist, but that it has no direct say in how Craigslist determines what ads are worth reporting. ""We are not a part of their initial screening and review process, and don't see exactly what their screeners see or know how they make their determinations as to what is actionable and reportable,"" director Ernie Allen wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""We are now getting reports from them regarding suspected violations and that is a good thing. The key question is -- are they doing enough?"" To another national advocacy group, the Rebecca Project, there's only one answer to Craigslist's adult services dilemma: Shut it down. The Rebecca Project has published open letters to Newmark from a former underage prostitute who says her pimp forced her to sell her body and used Craigslist to drum up customers. ""We hear this story every single day of girls who are being bought and sold, American girls who are being bought and sold through the internet,"" said Malika Saada Saar, executive director of the Rebecca Project. Read Saada Saar's commentary on CNN.com . She believes many Americans are either unaware of just how many girls are being sold on sites like Craigslist or simply chose to ignore the problem. ""I think we have an easier time looking at these girls when they are in India or Thailand and being thoughtful or supportive of those girls,"" Sadaa Saar said. ""But when those girls come from Southeast D.C., or Toledo, Ohio, or Atlanta, Georgia, we are challenged at being able to see them as victims. It's much easier to call them bad girls or girls acting out, as opposed to recognizing these are girls who are vulnerable, who are being raped and exploited."""
"By . Zoe Szathmary . and Associated Press Reporter . A Wyoming landslide about the size of two football fields continues to slowly move down a hill, causing nearby residents to evacuate - and splitting apart one home. 48 Jackson residents as well as several businesses were evacuated, according to a CNN report. The residents checked in to a Red Cross station. So far, only one unoccupied home has sustained any damage. The house is directly atop the slide zone and its interior wooden floor seems to be splitting in two, Assistant Town Manager Roxanne Robinson told the channel. Crack: A large fissure can be seen in the ground in this photo . Landslide: the landslide continues to shift, officials say making it unsafe for Jackson residents to return home . Hope: a geologist put the risk of sudden collapse at just 5 percent . 'What really struck me is the wood flooring, which is separating,' Robinson said. 'One half of the house looks like it's on side of the slide area and the other half is definitely at the crest of the slide.' Robinson also said that the home's driveway is cracked by a 6-1o-12-inch upward fissure. According to CNN, the landslide moves slowly enough for officials to observe ground cracks and monitor its path each day. Officials say the landslide continues to shift, making it unsafe for residents of mostly apartments to return home even though the apartments are outside the area where the highest risk of a collapse exists. 'The cracks continue to widen and deepen,' Robinson said on Saturday. 'If it keeps sliding every day, other complications could arise.' Evacuated: 48 Jackson residents have reported to a Red Cross station . Damage: a large crack can also be seen in this photo of the affected Jackson area . Helping hand: the American Red Cross is set to open a shelter for displaced residents on Sunday night . Residents are allowed escorted access to their homes to check on them and pick up personal belongings, but no one is allowed to stay overnight, Robinson said. About 43 people were escorted to their homes on Saturday as well as between 9am and 5pm on Sunday, according to a town press release.  Residents requesting escorted access on Monday will be able to do so by appointment only. The Red Cross has provided 18 displaced residents with hotel rooms until now. But the continuing uncertainty of when they can return home has led the agency to open a shelter. Evacuees were told that they can report to the Teton County Fair Grounds Exhibition Hall at 6pm on Sunday night, according to a town press release. Displaced: no one can say right now when residents might be allowed back home . No one can say right now when residents might be allowed back home, Robinson said. Robinson said portable water tanks were being placed on the unstable hill in case a fire breaks out. The shifting hill has broken permanent water lines, and the temporary water lines that have been put in place don't provide sufficient pressure for firefighting, she said. There are power lines on the hill that could be brought down by the slide and spark a fire. 'It's definitely dry on the hill, and we need to have a water supply that we can access in a hurry should it be necessary,' said Mike Moyer, an official with the local incident command team. At the foot of the slide zone, two restaurants, a liquor store and a just-built Walgreens remain closed amid a slim but persistent risk the hill could collapse suddenly. A geologist put the risk of sudden collapse at just 5 percent."
"By . Nick Enoch . It's sleek, British and wouldn't look out of place in a Bond movie. Petrolheads will be salivating at the sight of the Speedback - a new luxury sports car which was unveiled today. Made by David Brown Automotive, the GT was designed and built in Britain, has a bespoke interior and a handcrafted aluminium body. And although it takes some of its inspiration from the classic Aston Martin DB5, the connection ends there. David Brown looks on as the finishing touches are applied to  Speedback - the new luxury British sports car made by his company, in Coventry . The car has more than a passing resemblance to an 1960s Aston Martin DB5 (pictured). From the stylish air vents, to the large, circular lights and silver spoked wheels, the Speedback could easily pass for a modern update of James Bond's famous car . When viewed from the front, the Speedback could easily be mistaken for a DB5 thanks to its wide grill and bonnet ventilation . The car's grill, bonnet and front lighting is an almost identical shape to that seen on an 1960s Aston Martin DB5 (pictured). If you saw the Speedback in your rear-view mirror, it would be difficult to tell the two cars apart . Company founder and CEO, David Brown has . a long-standing background in engineering, vehicle manufacturing and an . equally strong enthusiasm for both classic and contemporary cars - . although he has no link with either Aston Martin or its founder, . Sir David Brown. The Speedback is driven by a Jaguar supercharged V8, a six-speed automatic gearbox and can achieve 0-62mph in 4.8 seconds with a top speed limited to 155mph. Next week, the Speedback will travel to Monaco to be shown publicly for the first time at the exclusive Top Marques show, which runs at the Grimaldi Forum from April 17 to 20. The cars look even more alike from behind. The Speedback's rear lights rise slightly from the boot, giving the car aerodynamic tail fins . Meanwhile the DB5 was famous for its tail fins. They were seen as a nod to the iconic fins seen on American cars during the 1950s, although delivered with an understated British cool that perfectly captured the mood of the following decade . It is driven by a Jaguar supercharged V8, a six-speed automatic gearbox and can achieve 0-62mph in 4.8 seconds with a top speed limited to 155mph. The Speedback is pictured sitting in front of its concept clay model . David Brown began to assemble his build team two years ago. Above, a detail of the dashboard controls, and part of the rear-light cluster . David Brown (car's emblem pictured) said: 'The launch of Speedback is the realisation of a dream for me, and is the result of skilful and dedicated work by a team of highly talented designers, engineers and craftsmen' Although the price tag of the car is not yet know, it is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands.

'I am delighted at the reaction of our suppliers, potential customers and friends, and I look forward to presenting the car to the public in Monaco. 'The Speedback name perfectly reflects . the classic sports car tradition of the past, while also doing justice . to the sophisticated silhouette of the car’s hand-built body and unique . styling which features, among much other detail, a fold-down picnic . seat.' Made by David Brown Automotive, the GT has been designed and built in Britain, has a bespoke interior and a handcrafted aluminium body . The supercar will be produced in 'limited numbers' according to Mr Brown . Engineers, designers and craftsmen put the finishing touches to Speedback . The car is the result of 18 months of hard work by the David Brown Automotive team, including chief designer Alan Mobberley. 'This car will appeal to anybody who desires a truly individual sports car, which can boast a fine British pedigree and which will only be produced in limited numbers. 'This will ensure the kind of exclusivity associated with Britain’s once proud heritage of traditional, high-quality, automotive coach- building,' said Mr Brown. Although the price tag is not yet known, it is likely to be in the hundreds of thousands of pounds... so you'd better start saving.

"With only hours left to live, cancer patient and right-to-die activist Brittany Maynard took the time to reach out to a stranger whom she had come to view as a kindred spirit. Maynard, the 29-year-old newlywed suffering from terminal brain cancer who has emerged as the face of the death-with-dignity movement, passed away peacefully at her Portland, Oregon, home November 1 after taking a lethal drug. In the hours before she ended her life, Maynard sent an email to Barbara Mancini, a former nurse from Philadelphia, who had written to her in late October to express her support for her controversial decision. Scroll down for videos . Kindred spirits: Terminally ill Brittany Maynard (left) penned a note to Barbara Mancini (right) encouraging her to continue the fight for the right to die with dignity . Poster girl: Maynard, 29, has become the face of the death-with-dignity movement after going public with her decision to end her life on her own terms . ‘In the note, I told her I admired what she was doing. I felt it was selfless and courageous,’ Mancini told ABC News Thursday. ‘I never expected she would respond because it was late October and I knew she was having daily seizures and she was getting worse all the time.’ Maynard and Mancini never met in person, but the 29-year-old woman knew of her story, which made national headlines last year. Barbara Mancini, a 58-year-old married mother of two, was arrested in 2013 for giving her terminally ill 93-year-old father a lethal dose of morphine to end his suffering. Letter from a stranger: In October, Mancini sent Maynard an email expressing her support for her. Pictured here is Brittany with her husband on their wedding day . Loving family: Maynard's decision to end her suffering was supported by her newlywed husband, Dan Diaz, (left) and her mother, Debbie Ziegler (right) After a drawn-out and costly legal battle that saw Mancini suspended from her job, she was cleared of all charges this past February, but her brush with the law over assisted suicide has left an indelible impression on her. In her email written shortly before drawing her last breath, Maynard wrote to Manicni telling her she was familiar with her ordeal and encouraging her to continue fighting for the right to die with dignity. 'I am so sorry you had to endure that,' she wrote, according to People Magazine. 'It was clear to me, in my heart, that you were doing your very best to care for your terminally ailing father. 'That is a difficult job. As a terminally ill person myself, I understand what the level of sacrifice means for a loving and supportive family on an emotional, physical and financial level. Harrowing tale: Barbara Mancini was arrested last year for giving her dying 93-year-old father (right) morphine . Exonerated: In February, the registered nurse, pictured here with her late father, was cleared of assisted suicide charges . Mancini's supporters said the state of Pennsylvania was imposing itself in Joseph Yourshaw's desire to end his own life after suffering numerous health complications . ‘Stories like yours and mine put human faces on a controversial topic that many politicians are happy to sweep under the rug,’ Maynard wrote. ‘I wish I could have had the pleasure of meeting you in person.’ Mrs Manicni said she was 'deeply touched' by the dying woman's last note and vowed to carry on her legacy. ‘I truly believe it's the right thing to allow dying people who are mentally competent have a choice in how their life ends,’ she said. Late last month, Mancini quit her job as a nurse to become a spokesperson for Compassion & Choices advocating for more death with dignity laws. Brittany Maynard went public with her decision to end her life to raise funds through the organization Compassion & Choices to advocate for assisted suicide as an option for terminally ill patients. She was featured on the cover of People magazine last month. Gracious: With just hours left to live, Maynard, pictured here with her mother, wrote to Mancini telling her she was familiar with her story and encouraging her to continue advocating for the right to die . Rest in peace: Maynard, a brain cancer victim, passed away November 1 after taking a lethal medication . Maynard was diagnosed in January with a glioblastoma brain tumor and moved from her San Francisco Bay Area home to Oregon, one of five states that allow assisted suicides for terminally ill patients. 'Goodbye to all my dear friends and family that I love. Today is the day I have chosen to pass away with dignity in the face of my terminal illness, this terrible brain cancer that has taken so much from me … but would have taken so much more. The world is a beautiful place, travel has been my greatest teacher, my close friends and folks are the greatest givers. I even have a ring of support around my bed as I type … . Goodbye world. Spread good energy. Pay it forward!' Since 1997, more than 750 patients in Oregon have died from ingesting medications prescribed under the state's death with dignity law, according to the Oregon Public Health Division. Barbara Mancini, then 57 years old, was charged in the summer of 2013 with giving a nearly full one-ounce bottle of morphine to her father, Joseph Yourshaw, at his Pottsville home in February 2013 for the purpose of helping him end his life. Yourshaw died at a hospital four days later after a hospice nurse called 911. The 93-year-old man had a Do Not Resuscitate order and had made it clear he wanted to die after enduring excrutiating pain for two weeks. In February, a Pennsylvania judge exonerated Mancini after ruling that the state Attorney General's Office failed to prove that the woman had committed a crime. New calling: Mancini quit her job as a nurse last month to become an advocate with the right-to-die organization Compassion & Choices ."

A man has been left paralyzed after heroically diving into a creek to save a four-year-old girl from drowning. Michael Patterson, 43, was visiting the Euharlee Creek in northwest Georgia with his son on Saturday when the girl was fragged underwater. Authorities say the four-year-old had been playing in the creek and stepped into a section of deep water. Patterson dove into the water and was able to rescue the girl but hit his head during the dive and broke his neck, paralyzing him instantly. Scroll down for video . Devoted father: Michael Patterson, 43, has been hailed a hero after he dived into a creek to save a little girl and ended up paralyzed when he brok his neck . Tragic: Mr Patterson, who is in the ICU, was paralyzed the second that he hit the water and his young son witnessed him floating face down in the creek . He was taken to hospital and doctors say the man is now paralyzed from the chest down. Mr Patterson's life-altering tragedy is heightened by the fact that he now faces massive medical bills - but does not have health insurance because he recently started a new job. The father had jumped in as he feared for the safety of a little girl who was being swept away by the fast-flowing current. Javea Jones was dragged under water, her mother Carlissa said, describing it as the worst moment of her life - until the Good Samaritan took action. She described Mr Patterson as a 'hero' and an 'angel'. After he had saved her daughter, Mrs Jones said that she saw the man floating on top of the water. Mr Patterson's nine-year-old son also witnessed the horrific moment that his father broke his neck on hitting the water. Rescued: Javea Jones was pulled from under the water by Mr Patterson who was critically injured during his act of heroism . Family day: The two parents had brought their children to play at this creek in Georgia before the day took a tragic turn . Mr Patterson was pulled from the water by four men and given CPR until an ambulance arrived. The 43-year-old is in intensive care at Redmond Medical Center in Rome where he has been made aware of his life-altering injuries. Remarkably, it is the second time in two weeks that Mr Patterson has saved someone's life after pulling a truck driver to safety when his rig caught on fire. Vicki Davis, Mr Patterson's mother, says he recently started a job installing sheet rock and doesn't have health insurance. Mrs Davis told wsbtv.com: 'Pray and pray, and have a lot of faith. That's all I can do.' She hopes that a medical fund can be established to help her hero son but as of yet nothing has been set up."
"A medal struck by the Royal Mint to mark 70 years since the end of the Holocaust was unveiled last night, with the first presented to some of the dwindling number of survivors. Chancellor George Osborne and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, who commissioned the silver medal, said it was vital to keep ‘retelling’ the story of the murder of six million Jews. The first of the run of medals were awarded to survivors and supporters of the Holocaust Education Trust in Downing Street last night, and a limited number will be on sale on the Royal Mint’s website. The obverse features the words ‘Liberation 1945’ in a typeface reflecting that used at Belsen, breaking through barbed wire. The reverse commemorates the 11th Armoured Division, the British forces that liberated the camp, and a stylised eternal flame that has come to symbolise the Holocaust victims . The obverse features the words ‘Liberation 1945’ in a typeface reflecting that used at Belsen, breaking through barbed wire. The reverse commemorates the 11th Armoured Division, the British forces that liberated the camp, and a stylised eternal flame that has come to symbolise the Holocaust victims. Among those who were presented with the first medals were Gena Turgel, 90, who was liberated from Bergen-Belsen in April 1945 . Having lost seven of her eight siblings and a tiny nephew in the Holocaust. Incarcerated in three concentration camps, she survived a trip to the gas chamber and forced marches between the camps and now lives in England. Ben Helfgott , 85, a Polish born British Holocaust survivor and former champion weightlifter, was another recipient at last night’s reception in Downing Street. Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, which takes schoolchildren on visits to Auschwitz, said: ‘We are delighted that the Chancellor has announced the commissioning of a special commemorative medal to mark 70 years since the end of the Holocaust. ‘This will mean a great deal to the Holocaust survivors who rebuilt their lives in Britain after losing their homes, families and communities at the hands of the Nazis. The commemorative medal is a perfect tribute for this significant anniversary year.’ Chancellor George Osborne, with Karen Pollock (centre right) the Holocaust Educational Trust Chief Executive, presented the medals in Downing Street to (left to right) Harry Spiro, Gena Turgel (seated), Zigi Shipper, Mala Tribich, Ben Helfgott and Hannah Lewis . Mr Osborne said: ‘Here we stand in Downing Street in tribute to fight against Nazism. In tribute to the millions who died. In tribute to the brave survivors. In tribute to the liberators. ‘And by our very standing in this place – you the survivors, you the liberators, you the people who keep the memory alive, and me and my colleagues, the democratic representatives of a free nation. By our very standing we symbolise that freedom won and tyranny lost. And we restate our determination that freedom will always triumph.’ Mr Pickles added: ‘Shining a light on the darkness of the Holocaust is no easy task. Not easy because it involves reliving one of humanity’s most shameful periods. It means retelling stories that are sometimes too shocking for words. ‘But there is only one way to avoid such monstrosities again – through constant vigilance for the first signs of intolerance.’ The presentation came as David Cameron sought to reassure Jewish leaders of Britain's ability to protect the community following the terror attacks in Paris. ‘We have to recognise that in a modern democracy you can never protect every threat, but we should do everything we can and be as vigilant as we can to help reassure,’ Mr Cameron said after a meeting in Number Ten. The Prime Minster said it had been deeply moving to be in Paris on Sunday for the unity marches and recalled seeing people holding signs reading ‘Je Suis Juif’. ‘We should use the momentum of those great demonstrations to emphasise what we are in this country: a very successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith democracy,’ he said. The meeting also discussed rising antisemitism in Britain and growing numbers of anti-Israel boycotts on university campuses."

A 47-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder . Police who this morning launched a manhunt after a woman's body was discovered at a house in Middlesbrough have arrested a 47-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Officers had urged the public not to approach Graham Barry Gibson, thought to be the former partner of the dead woman, whose identity has yet to be confirmed.

"If a golf course were to be created in Hell it might resemble the now serene landscape of Gallipoli, where the blood of thousands was spilled a century ago in one of World War I’s most spectacular Allied failures. An eerie serenity pervades the rolling landscape of this peninsula and, in the bright spring sunshine, there could scarcely be a more peaceful spot for a Sunday afternoon stroll. But a chill is never far from the spine, whatever the temperature. Scroll down for video . Sulva Bay, Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey, where in the World War I there were nearly 400,00 Allied casualties . In the early hours of today, 25 April 2015, a bugle sounded a haunting dawn chorus to mark the moment when, at 0430, Allied troops landed at a point where Asia meets Europe, Anzac Cove, to commence the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign. Thousands of visitors from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, India and France have gathered to honour the fallen at one of the biggest commemorations of the Great War. Today this beautiful Turkish isthmus, facing the Aegean to the west, the Dardanelles Straits and the Sea of Marmara to the east, is a patchwork of monuments and memorial stones linked by country lanes, mountain tracks and undulating greenery. Allied soldiers land and begin the attack at Gallipoli, sometimes known as the Dardanelles Campaign . People have been gathering the graves at Beach Cemetery at Gallipoli to mark the campaigns's centenary . Allied cemeteries at Gallipoli are kept immaculately by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . A cross left by a visitor at a graveside in Gallipoli bearing a personal thanks to the one of the soldiers killed . On a visit ahead of the poignant anniversary, we wandered among Anzac’s sea-facing white headstones before heading down to the tip of the peninsula. Here stands one of the most magnificent of the cemeteries, the Helles Memorial to the British. Troops are remembered in row upon row of immaculate Commonwealth war graves and huge expanses of dazzling white marble, etched with the names of the fallen, which circle the cemetery. Accompanied by a feral dog and her puppies, we strolled down the dirt track to V Beach cemetery where the sea laps below the walls and where two Irish battalions were laid to rest. The mighty ruined fortress of Seddülbahir, brought to its knees by Allied naval firepower in 1915, overlooks the cemetery. The ruins of the fortress at Seddülbahir in Gallipoli - its name in Turkish means 'barrier to the sea' Seaside homes dot the flat sands and yellow sandstone bluffs rise out of the Aegean. In the valleys between the cliffs, olive and tamaris trees grow down the steep escarpments. We stopped for a stiff coffee at a modest coffee house on the square, opposite the mosque at Sedd al Bahr, and watched the fishermen’s tiny rowing boats bobbing in the slack waters of Cape Helles. A far cry from the fateful morning of April 25 1915, when one of the bloodiest and most ill-conceived campaigns of the First World War kicked off, a campaign which almost brought to an end the career of its main instigator, Winston Churchill, and which witnessed almost 400,000 casualties. The Allied plan was as brilliantly simple in conception as it was hopeless in execution: secure the Straits and take Constantinople, giving access to the Black Sea to supply the Russians in order to free up a new line of attack on the Germans. It would also pull in the Greeks and Bulgarians, ancient enemies of the Ottoman Turks, and hey presto, the stalemate of the Western Front would be suddenly transformed into a glorious victory from the East. Churchill, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, had underestimated the strength of the Turkish troops, under the command of modern Turkey’s founding father, Kemal Atatürk, and had overestimated the potency of his own superannuated fleet, which fell easy prey to the mines and coastal gun batteries. Churchill (left) had been a soldier, but in 1916 underestimated the Turkish  forces led by Atatürk (right) If the naval thrust was a failure, his attempt to consolidate on land was a calamity, and after nine months of blistering summer heat and frostbitten winter nights the ragbag army of dysentery-ridden men was evacuated the following December and January, and Churchill was forced to resign his post. The easiest way to access the peninsula is from the port of Canakkale, which is a quick ferry ride across the narrowest section of the Straits. The Gallipoli War Museum (Canakkale Destani Tanitim Merkezi), is well hidden from view but well worth finding. This 5,600 square metre visitor centre, on the road to Kabatepe, was commissioned by the army and the Ministry of Defence and was only recently finished. It is an architectural triumph that does justice to its subject. The Gallipoli War Museum has many relics from the campaign from both the Allies and Turkish sides . In addition to 11 rooms, with cinema screens shockingly simulating what it was like in the trenches of Gallipoli. There are also some rather more prosaic offerings which carry poignant memento mori: bullets with bullet holes in them as well as Atatürk’s waistcoat and dress shoes. There are also letters, watches, mangled boots and water canteens that would be inadequate for a summer school trip to Longleat safari park. Items of clothing worn in battle by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk who commanded the Turkish forces at Gallipoli . The battle sites and 31 memorials to the 130,000 dead covers a surprisingly small area. This is because Allied troops were unable to make much headway against the ferocious onslaught of Atatürk’s men. Heat, exhaustion, illness and difficult terrain also dogged every step. With an impressive flourish of national pride, the Turkish government has declared the whole area a Historic Park, to show the futility of war. Up at Chunuk Bair, where the Allies enjoyed a shortlived victory, the trenches have been preserved. You can look down on Suvla Bay 540m below, where British troops landed, and walk a few hundred metres along the preserved dug-outs in the footsteps of New Zealand’s Wellington Battalion, before visiting the New Zealand monument. Here, a statue to Atatürk, the Allies’ nemesis, celebrates the moment when a fob watch covering his heart prevented a bullet from possibly changing the course of modern history. From the Australian monument at Lone Pine there are views across the peninsula, from the Aegean to the Dardanelles. Nearby is Kiliçbayiri, the memorial to the Turkish 57th Infantry Regiment, which was wiped out following the Allied landings at Anzac. Atatürk, the 19th Division commander, famously told his men: ""I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. During the time before we die other forces and commanders will take our place."" The great man, of course, lived to tell the tale. Before taking the 10-minute ferry back across the Straits to Canakkale we walked through the French Memorial at Morto Bay. Lined by rosemary bushes, baytrees and well-ordered flowerbeds, this is perhaps the biggest and most atmospheric of them all, with 3,236 graves and four ossuaries containing the bones of 12,000 unidentifiable soldiers. It surprises many to learn that more French soldiers were killed at Gallipoli than Australians and New Zealanders combined. Mark Porter was a guest of the Turkish Culture and Tourism Office.

While the 100th anniversary itself is going to be a tad too busy for most, the museum and Historic Park are open to all 365-days a year. For those unable to make the celebrations on the day, there is always a fallback position: Russell Crowe’s film about it, The Water Diviner, is out now ."
"Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said he had no confidence in the figures, insisting no one knows how many migrants will flock to Britain . The number of Romanian and Bulgarian migrants expected when the UK opens its doors next January was put at just 12,700, according to long-hidden figures. The total, compiled under the Labour government, was  immediately rejected as ‘ridiculous’ by senior Coalition figures. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said the estimates, revealed yesterday after months of cover-up by ministers, were drawn up by Labour after comparing the two countries to Poland, which has sent around one million people to the UK. The document predicts just 4,613 Bulgarians, out of a population of 7.5million, will come to Britain every year, along with 8,156 Romanians – a tiny fraction of its 21.4million inhabitants. Addressing Westminster journalists, Mr Pickles said he had ‘no confidence’ in the figures and that was why ministers chose not to publicise them, though he said they were slipped out on a Whitehall website in 2011. The total of 12,769 is very  similar to the 13,000 Labour ministers claimed would come to the UK in 2004, when immigration restrictions were lifted on Poland and nine other Eastern European countries. In the event, more than a million people have flocked to Britain from Poland alone over the last nine years. Mr Pickles revealed that the research existed in a television interview in January, but immigration minister Mark Harper refused to release the study, saying it would not be ‘helpful’. The Home Office had even sought to claim that no such estimates existed. Yesterday Mr Pickles said: ‘These are calculations. I don’t have any confidence in them whatsoever.’ He added that he doesn’t know how many immigrants will come to the UK in January but hopes it will be lower than in 2004, when many other EU countries refused to lift restrictions at the same time as Britain. Ministers are drawing up a package of emergency measures to deter Romanian and Bulgarian migrants from flocking to Britain when limits are lifted next year . He said: ‘Last time, we, Ireland and Sweden opened up our boundaries, when France and Germany and Spain didn’t  open up their boundaries, so a  disproportionately large number of Poles came to the UK. ‘This time everyone is opening up at the same time. If you combine Romania and Bulgaria they don’t even meet the level of the Polish population.’ He added: ‘Bulgarians and Romanians have a link with Spain and with France.’ The campaign group Migration Watch UK has estimated up to 75,000 Romanians and Bulgarians could enter the UK a year. Commenting on the figures, chairman . Sir Andrew Green said: ‘We regard the estimate as much too low and agree . with Mr Pickles that it is not a sufficient basis for policy. ‘For a start it ignores the two . million Romanians in Spain and Italy, many of whom are now unemployed . and might move to Northern Europe.’ Mr Pickles added: ‘No matter how many fancy calculations you can make, I don’t know. The truth is nobody really knows. ‘All the government can do is be . careful about pull factors that might range from the health service to . housing and benefits to try to ensure there isn’t an extra attraction to . come here.’ Ministers are making plans to require . new immigrants to register to use public services or claim benefits. The Government is also considering sending home those who fail to find . work. Minister for local government Brandon Lewis denied there had been a cover-up. He said: ‘We have been open and transparent in publishing research . . . ‘This analysis was produced by the . last administration, and should be treated with extreme caution given . how unreliable their statistics have been historically.’"
"(CNN) -- In the United States, we don't vacation often. And thanks to our ever-growing cadre of mobile gadgets, some experts fear that we don't vacation very well, either. Smartphones, laptops, tablet computers and other devices make it easier than ever to stay plugged in all the time. That's not exactly news. But there's a growing awareness, and concern, that the same items designed to keep us engaged and entertained around the clock can also make it harder for us to ever actually relax. Sure, we're on vacation at the shore, or a peaceful lakeside cabin in the woods. But it can't hurt to whip out the laptop and check work e-mail real quickly, right? You know, just in case something big happened back at the office. Maybe you can't resist peeking at your phone to see what your co-workers are up to on Facebook. Or, you know, to get in a quick round of Words With Friends, or a game of Qrank during that long sunset stroll on the beach. And never mind how many miles there are between you and the office. In 2011, your boss knows you're always just an electronic nudge away. As part of our No Vacation Nation series, we talked to two authors: Daniel Sieberg, writer of ""The Digital Diet"" and William Powers, author of ""Hamlet's BlackBerry: A Practical Philosophy for Building a Good Life in the Digital Age."" Both books address finding a healthy balance in our use of technology. The authors shared some tips on how to keep your gadget in check while on vacation. On why it's important . Sieberg: If you respond to one (work) e-mail, you've just opened the floodgates. You've lost that barrier -- it's gone like a sandcastle in front of the ocean. Now that person knows that you're really not on vacation. You are reachable and you will respond. Hold onto that. Otherwise, it's just a slippery slope to just responding to everything. ... It's not giving you that clarity in your head that you're seeking from a vacation -- the reason you did it in the first place. Powers: It feels like a small thing we're doing. ""I'll just check Facebook"" or ""I'll just go into this one little game I like to do."" What we forget is that it actually takes you into a different state of mind. It's a different type of consciousness, the digital one. That may not be true in 20 years, when we've adjusted to it. But it is now. Create rules for when you can use gadgets . Sieberg: Say, 'Thirty minutes is what I'm going to do.' Then close it down. Put it away. Give it to somebody else. Powers: The No. 1 thing is to set up rituals for yourself and stick to it. It could be once a day. It could be twice in a week. But set those times ahead of time and stick to it. Get friends, family to help . Powers: Get other people, the people you're traveling with, to work with you. Work with each other on it and support each other. You can make it a game. If one person takes the plunge back into 'screen life,' it's easy to follow them. Ban gadgets during meals .

"Today we call them 'trolls' but in 1911, ground-breaking physicist Albert Einstein coined a different term for relentless critics: 'reptiles.' In a newly unearthed letter he wrote to fellow-physicist Marie Curie, Mr Einstein urged his friend to ignore a series of scandalous rumors concerning her heritage and her love life which were circling her at the time. 'If the rabble continues to occupy itself with you, then simply don't read that hogwash, but rather leave it to the reptile for whom it has been fabricated,' Mr Einstein, then 32, wrote on November 23, 1911. Ignore the trolls: In a newly unearthed letter Einstein (left) wrote to fellow-physicist Marie Curie (right), Mr Einstein urged his friend to ignore a series of scandalous rumors that were circling her at the time . Astrobiologist David Grinspoon found the letter in a newly-released archive published by Princeton University Press. At the time, Mrs Curie, the first women to win a Novel Prize and a then-38-year-old widow, was being hounded by accusations not only that she was Jewish, and thus undeserving of a position at the French Academy of Sciences, but also that she was having an affair with a married man. The former rumor was false, and the latter turned out to be true. In 1911, Mrs Curie, based in Paris with her two daughters, was competing against 66-year-old Edouard Branly for a physicist seat at the esteemed French Academy of Sciences. Right-wring French newspaper Excelsior was among those who attacked her candidacy, asking incredulously in one headline 'will a woman enter the Institute?' and claiming she was secretly Jewish based on 'scientific' analysis of her facial characteristics and handwriting. That autumn, amid the media storm, Mrs Curie joined Mr Einstein as the only woman at an international physics conference in the Belgian capital of Brussels. Wise words: Astrobiologist David Grinspoon found the letter (pictured) in a newly-released archive published by Princeton University Press . In Mr Einstien's subsequent November letter to Mrs Curie, he wrote: 'I am impelled to tell you how much I have come to admire your intellect, your drive, and your honesty, and that I consider myself lucky to have made your personal acquaintance in Brussels.' When Mrs Curie arrived back in Paris, even more accusations had built against her; this time in regards to her relationship with fellow physicist Paul Langevin, who was married but estranged from his wife. The French press got their hands on intimate letters exchanged between Ms Curie and Mr Langevin, and promptly declared her a home-wrecker, according to the American Institute of Physics. 'On her return to France, Mrs Curie discovered an angry mob congregated in front of her home in Sceaux, terrorizing 14-year-old Irène and seven-year-old Eve. 'Mrs Curie and her daughters had to take refuge in the home of friends in Paris,' the site states. Mr Einstein's letter in response to the scandal begins: 'Do not laugh at me for writing you without having anything sensible to say. 'But I am so enraged by the base manner in which the public is presently daring to concern itself with you that I absolutely must give vent to this feeling.' Mr Einstein goes on to presume that Mrs Curie probably 'despise[s] this rabble' and blasts the rumor-mills and their 'lust for sensationalism.' He then refers directly to her relationship with Mr Langevin and states he is 'happy' to have Mrs Curie and Mr Langevin as 'personages', describing them as: 'real people with whom one feels privileged to be in contact.' Laugh it off: In 1911, Mrs Curie (right) was facing scandalous rumors that she was secretly Jewish and a home-wrecker, accusations that led Mr Einstein (left) to 'vent' his disapproval . Although Ms Curie didn't get her seat at the French Academy of Science, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry that very same year. It was her second win, having won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. When members of the Swedish Academy of Sciences wrote to Mrs Curie to dissuade her from coming to Sweden to accept her 1911 Nobel Prize based on her bad press, the plucky scientist responded: . 'The prize has been awarded for the discovery of radium and polonium... I cannot accept that the appreciation of the value of scientific work should be influenced by libel and slander concerning private life.' Mrs Curie died in 1934 at the age of 66 from aplastic anemia, which was believed to have been contracted from her long-term exposure to radiation. In a 2009 poll carried out by New Scientist, she was voted the 'most inspirational woman in science.' Mr Einstein, who developed the  general theory of relativity in 1916 and won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, was famed for his outspoken manner, and his letter to Mrs Curie was characteristic of this approach. He died in 1955 at the age of 76 and left a long legacy of wise-cracking wisdom. 'Only two things are infinite,' he once said. 'The universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former.'"
"DNA testing has lead the investigators to D'Marcus Tucker, 15, who was charged with first-degree murder on Monday . A 15-year-old boy has been charged with the murder of a young woman who was found stabbed to death at her Florida home five months ago. Nicole Franco, 19, who worked as a pastry chef at the Boca Raton Resort & Club, was murdered in her own bed on June 3. DNA testing has lead the investigation to D'Marcus Tucker, 15, a neighbor at the gated Bridgewater Place apartments in Oakland Park. Tucker was charged on Monday with one count of first-degree murder. According to the sheriff's department, Tucker entered Franco's ground-floor apartment through a sliding door and grabbed a knife from her kitchen. He then went into Franco’s bedroom and took her wallet from her purse. As he turned to leave, Tucker accidentally stepped on the purse, which awoke Franco. Police said a startled Tucker then stabbed Franco multiple times in the chest. Tucker allegedly told police he watched Franco dial 911 before fleeing and throwing the wallet into a lake behind the apartments. During the 911 call, Franco told the call-taker someone had broken into her house and beat her. However, she fell unconscious before she could provide more details. Deputies arriving to the apartment building had to go door-to-door at 4:11 a.m. to find Franco’s apartment. They eventually noticed the open sliding glass door and discovered her body. Tucker had entered the Fort Myers Youth Academy, a juvenile facility in Lee County, on September 17 on another matter. Nicole Franco, 19, who worked as a pastry chef at the Boca Raton Resort & Club, was murdered in her own bed on June 3 . A DNA sample was obtained from him and entered into a state database. On Thursday, Tucker's DNA was found to match DNA evidence taken from Franco's bed. He was arrested the next day on suspicion of murder. Detectives searching Tucker's family's apartment have also found a knife with blood on it in the building's stairwell. Tucker has been moved to the Lee County Sheriff's jail and is awaiting transfer to Broward County Jail. Franco, originally from Park Ridge, New Jersey, moving to Florida in August of 2013 to attend The Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale. Franco is survived by four siblings and her parents Teri and Steven. Franco was able to call 911 after she was stabbed. She told the call-taker someone had broken into her house and beat her, but fell unconscious before she could provide more details . Both Franco and Tucker lived at the gated Bridgewater Place apartments in Oakland Park, Florida ."
"When it comes to World Cup pedigree, four- time winners Italy must make Roy Hodgson’s England green with envy. But there were plenty of questions to ponder for coach Cesare Prandelli as Italy’s World Cup boot camp got under way at their fabulous training complex in Coverciano, just outside Florence. Prandelli’s men are unique among the 32 nations heading for Brazil in not having a single player among their provisional squad who is based in England. VIDEO Scroll down for Balotelli and Pirlo lead Italy training ahead of the World Cup . Casting an eye: Cesare Prandelli watches on as his Italy team began their bootcamp in Florence .

There were 31 . players doing laps of the track and fitness tests in 80 degree heat on Tuesday. As he addressed the media for the first time, the manager . didn’t seem to have much idea who was going to make the cut from his . provisional squad named last week. The . problems are particularly acute up front where all the  contenders have . different issues. Antonio Cassano is unpredictable, ex-Manchester . United striker Giuseppe Rossi is coming off a long-term injury, Serie . A’s leading scorer Ciro Immobile is raw and Mario Balotelli is like . Cassano, but even more so. ‘I . will take my time to name my 23 right up until the deadline of June 2 . if I have to,’ said Prandelli. ‘This is what the camp is for, to assess . fitness and strength. Strength is important.’ And woe betide any mavericks — Balotelli and Cassano come to mind — who step out of line. ‘When . a player puts his ego ahead of everybody, then it becomes a problem. And it’s the same for me,’ said Prandelli. ‘We are working with the aim . of reaching the final.

Confident: Prandelli has picked friendlies against 'whipping boys' as Italy look to start a winning streak . Italy’s choice of warm-up games gives away how crucial they regard the opening fixture. Whereas .

Italy . play the Republic of Ireland at Craven Cottage on May 31 and then . Luxembourg, whipping boys Prandelli will use to boost confidence. Italy . outplayed England in the Euro 2012 quarter-final even though they only . advanced on penalties, but Prandelli expects a tougher task this time. ‘England . are younger, they are quicker and they have pace on the wings,’ he . noted. ‘And the English mentality is always good. In Manaus, when . conditions might be difficult, they won’t give in. ‘The . first game is normally key. If you get three points immediately, you . are up and running. Spain lost the first game at 2010 so there  are . exceptions, but we can’t think that way.’ Hard work: Balotelli sweats in the heat during the training session on Tuesday . Couldn't be better: Gianluigi Buffon winks at a nearby camera as Italy began their World Cup preparations . Calm: Italy will be looking to Andrea Pirlo to help them keep possession in the Brazilian heat . Just . as Balotelli dominated attention during his time at Manchester City, so . there were more questions asked about him than anyone else at . Prandelli’s conference. Nobody . is daring to suggest he will be left out the squad — his heroics at . Euro 2012 mean he is regarded as a wild card worth having. But . Balotelli, who has just had a disappointing season with AC Milan, didn’t . exactly bust a gut in training alongside the veteran Andrea Pirlo, . sauntering out an hour behind some of his colleagues clutching a bottle . of water. Prandelli said afterwards: ‘It was like the first day of school, a lot of emotion.’ He . promises to have the squad doing hard, double sessions before they . travel to play the Irish. Italy have no English-based player in the . squad but four — Balotelli (Manchester City), Rossi (Manchester United), . Gabriel Paletta and Alberto Aquilani (both  Liverpool) — have . previously been at big North West clubs. Tough: Antonio Cassano feels the burn during a sprint with coaches watching on . Determined to get there: Prandelli is not writing off Giuseppe Rossi, despite his lack of match fitness . Rossi, 27, has only played four times since recovering from a serious knee injury that kept him out for four months. Prandelli . is not writing him off, however, saying: ‘Rossi is very talented and . has shown the  spirit of a champion to come back in time.’ Italy have already had to change their media plans for today. Goalkeper . Gigi Buffon, one of four survivors from the Italy squad who won the . World Cup in 2006, would normally have spoken as team captain but he . will probably swerve it this time after announcing that he is . separating from his Czech wife Alena. A sympathetic Prandelli remarked: ‘I’m sorry because it’s upsetting for everyone when there is a separation.’ The coach’s football problems lie at the other end of the pitch and centre on who to select."
"The judge in the murder trial of Etan Patz today refused to release the man accused of killing the six-year-old after the prosecution reminded him of the brutal crime he confessed to. Pedro Hernandez, from New Jersey, appeared in court today, where his lawyer asked that he be released from jail immediately due to the slow-moving case and lack of evidence against his client. But the prosecution asked that this request be denied, reminding the court: 'Let's remember he killed a six-year-old child.' Manhattan state Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley said that due to Hernandez's mental state, he would remain in prison until the trial, which is due to begin in Spring 2014. Killing: Pedro Hernandez, right, told police he was guilty of murdering missing child Etan Patz, left . Hernandez, who was led into the court handcuffed by police, said nothing during the short hearing. His lawyer Harvey Fishbein expressed . his frustration at the speed at which the case was moving, . referring to it as Groundhog Day, and accused the prosecution of dragging their feet while his client is languishing in jail, where he has been since May 2012. Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi-Orbon said prosecutors were moving as fast as they could. Fishbein has always maintained that Hernandez is schizophrenic and bipolar, and that his admission was . false, peppered with questionable claims and made after almost seven . hours of police questioning. Hernandez has entered a not guilty plea in the case. Etan vanished on May 25, 1979. The anniversary was later named National Missing Children's Day in his memory. He became one of the first vanished children pictured on a milk carton. Hernandez was arrested last May after . police got a tip that he'd told people years before that he had killed a . child in New York City. Iconic: Etan was one of the earliest missing children to make national headlines when he disappeared in 1979 . He then told authorities he'd seen . Etan at the bus stop, offered the boy a soda to entice him to a corner . store where he worked and choked the boy in the basement. Hernandez said he tossed Etan's book . bag behind a basement freezer, put his limp body in a box and left it . with some trash about a block away. No body or bag has ever been found. Under New York law, a person can be . convicted based only on a confession if there's additional evidence that . a crime was committed. 'The evidence before the grand jury . (that indicted Hernandez) amply supports the offenses charged,' prosecutors wrote in a filing this winter. Scene: This is the site of the bodega in SoHo where Hernandez claims he killed Etan in 1979 ."
"(CNN) -- The height of luxury -- or a vulgar monstrosity? To its owner, this 15-meter, Lamborghini-inspired speedboat is the apex of nautical engineering. A sleek, innovative, gutsy vessel worthy of its $1.1 million price tag. But others disagree. When Gino Gargiulo turned up at the Miami Boat Show with his banana-yellow beauties in tow -- the boat and the $750,000 car it resembles -- a small crowd quickly gathered around. ""This is the best boat you can buy -- it's the Lamborghini of boats,"" says the 48-year-old automobile and restaurant mogul from Miami, Florida. ""The response we've had ... letters, emails. If you do a Google search today there are 14,000 pages on it already -- and the boat's never even been in the water."" However, not everyone is impressed by the idea of a high-performance sports car dressed up as a superyacht. To Quentin Willson, former presenter of BBC TV show ""Top Gear,"" the Lamborghini boat is a tasteless display of wealth that screams: ""I'm rich and bored."" Willson quickly moves into fourth gear with his analysis. ""And that's really sad. Anybody who's got that amount of money that they need to go and commission a special boat to keep them entertained -- I think it's nuts,"" he says. ""The key with these people is they want to be different, and they want to be separate, and they want to be distinctive -- and that impulse throws good taste, and reason, and rationale out the window."" Rags to riches . What really sets Gargiulo apart is not his wealth or supercar yachts -- it's the fact that more than 25 years ago he was penniless and living on the streets of New York. ""I was a drug addict, on cocaine and crack,"" says the father-of-one, who today owns a truck repair company, a car paintwork group, and a chain of hamburger restaurants. ""I lived in a halfway house for about a year. I really started with nothing and no help. And probably in fear of ever going back there, it's kept me motivated to this day. ""I work really hard, I make a good living, and all the things I didn't have for a long time, well now I can do it."" Billionaire bling . With his supercar yacht he has done it -- and then some. ""Like anybody that likes expensive things, it's definitely an ego thing,"" says Gargiulo, who also commissioned a Mercedes-style vessel in 2007. ""Maybe it's partially boredom. I'm one of those people that always has to have to have a project -- and I've been thinking about doing the Lamborghini boat for years."" The flashy vessel's engine package costs $400,000, a ""homage"" to his beloved Lamborghini car -- one of two he owns. Gargiulo is not the only one with an ego in overdrive, by the sounds of it. ""The people that own these boats, already own the vehicles,"" says Larry Goldman, owner of Xtremepowerboats, which as well as the Lamborghini and Mercedes has also sold Ferrari and Corvette-inspired yachts to other millionaires. ""Nobody wants a boat to resemble a car that they can't afford."" Daring design . Once someone decides they want a supercar yacht, it's up to engineers at Marine Technology Inc. to bring it to life, drawing up designs that take the most iconic features of the luxury automobile and transferring them to a working boat, capable of traveling 300 kilometers per hour. ""In the case of the Lamborghini, one of the most noticeable and sought-after features is the beautiful carbon-fiber scoops on the side of the car,"" says Goldman. ""They're quite pronounced and we wanted to make sure we used them in the design -- along with the exotic taillights and headlights, which are different to a normal car."" Sit in the driver's seat and the plush leather interior could easily be mistaken for the four-wheeled variety. The distinctive yellow paintwork is also identical, and seeing the two super vehicles together is a bit like witnessing a surreal Lamborghini festival for enthusiasts. A question of taste . There's no denying this is a rare and expensive yacht. But it's not for Willson. ""If I was wealthy enough to go down the boat route, I would buy myself a lovely old period Riva motorboat,"" he says, referring to the vintage Italian wooden vessel. ""When you start making bright yellow Lamborghini speedboats, I think it means you are firmly detached from reality,"" he says by phone, having just driven through London in his own Mercedes SLS -- a supercar worth Â£175,000 ($290,000) and capable of doing 300 kph. While Wilson ponders the meaning of taste, Gargiulo is getting his kicks from the adrenalin of driving one of these supercar yachts -- ""Like nothing else in the world,"" is how he puts it. When he first took his Mercedes version on the water, he felt like he was flying. ""I'm sure my wife Renea would prefer if I put a lot more money in the bank,"" he says. ""But this is just me."" ""I make a good living, I give to charity, and I like buying these kinds of things."" Learn: Celebrity architect's space-age superyacht . See: Meet the 'great ladies' of the ocean ."

Their plans for a futuristic £5million eco-home - complete with a sound-proofed cinema, solar panelled pods and a garish waterfall - were never going to be to everyone's taste. And it seems lottery millionaires Matt and Cassey Topham's new neighbours in upmarket Adams Hill in Nottinghamshire are distinctly unimpressed. After the Mail yesterday revealed how the young couple are planning to spend part of the £45million they scooped on the lottery on a bizarre new mansion, those living in the surrounding houses raised their eyebrows at the plans. The £1.2 million house in Nottingham will be transformed into an eight bedroom eco-home named 'Serenity' The couple will move into a far larger home than their previous one. Their new property appeared as 'Wayne Manor' in the latest Batman film The Dark Knight Rises . Neighbours described the home as being 'very out of character for the area' and looking like 'a collection of turtles'. Former painter and decorator Matt, 24, and his new wife Cassey, 23, a former Iceland supermarket supervisor, were described as 'lucky people with bad taste'. After winning the Euromillions in February 2012, the newlyweds, who were living in a £89,950 ex-council house in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire, announced they would spend some of the money on a 'dream home'. Within seven months, the Tophams had bought a 1930s mansion in Adams Hill, Nottingham, for £1.2million - which they now plan to demolish to make way for their new home, a £5million eight bedroom eco-home named 'Serenity'. Proposals for the house, which were lodged with the local authority on Thursday, outline how the property will boast a sound-proof cinema, a botanical garden and a swimming pool. EuroMillions winners Matt and Cassey Topham plan an eight-bedroom mansion with waterfall-screened garage and grotto swimming pool . Neighbours described the home as being 'very out of character for the area' and looking like 'a collection of turtles' Baca, the London-based architects behind the design, have described the property as a '21st century country house and hidden retreat' The home will include four wings or 'hubs' covered in solar panels, a dramatic sweeping staircase inside, and a garage with space for 10 cars. There they will keep their expanding collection of vehicles, including a Jaguar XKR-S and Range Rover Evoque, which are worth a combined £150,000. Mr Topham is also said to have bought a Porsche and an Aston Martin DB9 to replace the Peugeot 107 the couple used to share. The cars will be hidden by a waterfall of rainwater, which will flow from one pool at the centre of the mansion to a second pool below. The home, said to be fit for a Bond villain, will also back onto the grounds of a stunning country house which appeared as 'Wayne Manor' in the latest Batman film The Dark Knight Rises. Baca, the London-based architects behind the design, have described the property as a '21st century country house and hidden retreat' which is 'ultra-low in energy use but also high in aesthetic aspiration and quality'. Lottery winners Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington have planned to create a home which neighbours are disgusted by . After winning the Euromillions in February 2012, the newlyweds announced they would spend some of the money on a 'dream home' But locals in the exclusive neighbourhood of Adams Hill, Nottingham, said it looked 'tasteless' and 'disgusting'. Houses on the road, one of the most sought after in the area, sell for an average of £1.4million. Princess Diana stayed at a house there in 1990 when Prince Charles was receiving treatment at the nearby Queen's Medical Centre hospital for an elbow he damaged while playing polo. Housewife Lina Alamoudia, 30, said of the Tophams' new home: 'I don't like it at all. It looks like a collection of turtles. It is very out of character for the area. 'It is very unusual. With all that money they could have designed something far prettier. I haven't met them, or seen them at all since they moved in. They are lucky people with bad taste.' Another neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: 'It might be an eco-home and good for the environment but it looks pretty disgusting to me. 'It certainly isn't my cup of tea, and I think that would go for most people around here too.' A Nottingham City Council spokesman confirmed that an application had been received to demolish the Tophams' current home and build a new property on the site. He said its fate would be decided in July, adding: 'Planning officials have not had time to scrutinize the plans in detail but preliminary discussions have already taken place. 'The formal process of examining the application has now begun. Among the issues to be examined are any impact the new property would have on the surrounding area, including people who live locally.'"
"Ironing may be the Marmite of household chores. But, love it or loathe it, unless you want to look like you’ve slept on a park bench, you can’t avoid it. British company Swan, which sold its first iron in 1933, has just released a top-of-the-range steam generator iron, for £279.99. But does it really make things easier? Tessa Cunningham finds out. SUPER STEAMER . Swan SI9031N Steam Generator Iron, £279.99, swan-brand.co.uk . If you loathe ironing enough to splash out almost £300, then Swan’s luxury model could be the one for you. It cut my ironing time by half. It’s usually my least favouite chore, but when testing this one, I got to work in front of Poldark and was done within 20 minutes. Because all the water is in the separate 1,000ml generator tank, the iron itself is lightweight. The steam is forced out of the generator through a hose into the iron, shooting out at 90g per minute — twice as fast as conventional steam irons (think of the difference in power between jet-washing and using a hosepipe) — cutting through creases quicker. As well as being more powerful, it also produces twice as much steam, making shorter work of wrinkles. On the downside, despite the investment, you get only a two-year guarantee. 3/5 . PRECISION PERFECT . Philips Easy Speed Plus, £29.50, amazon.co.uk . The big selling point of this pretty aqua blue iron is the precision tip, which means you can get really sharp creases flat with minimum elbow grease, making it perfect for shirts and trousers. I also love the vertical steam option, which means you can smooth creases from hanging fabrics, such as curtains, by holding the iron vertically 2 in away and pressing the steam button. Steam output is 35g per minute — with a boost function of up to 120g to blast at stubborn creases. Impressive for the price. 4/5 . BARGAIN BUY . Swan Steam Iron SI1001ON, £19.99, argos.co.uk . This does an adequate job and you get a lot for your money — including a generous 350ml water tank and variable steam control, which means you can opt for continuous steam at 40g per min or a 140g per minute shot of steam. But it’s so heavy, at 1.3kg, that I’m in danger of developing muscles like Popeye if I keep using it. And while the dolphin-shaped nose helps me reach tricky areas, such as around shirt buttons, it makes the iron look downright ugly. I also found the soleplate scaled up quickly. 2/5 . POWER HOUSE . Braun TexStyle 7 TS755, £49.99, johnlewis.com . This looks like a fighter jet, and is so heavy (1.3kg empty and 1.65kg when the water tank is full) it makes ironing even more of an effort. On the plus side, the ergonomic handle is easy to hold. I also like the way the cable is 2.5m long — useful if you can’t get near a plug. It’s impressively powerful. Steam shoots out at 50g per minute and the precision shot also releases steam at 170g per minute. 3/5 . LIGHTWEIGHT PRO . Russell Hobbs Autosteam Pro Iron, £19.99, argos.co.uk . One of the cheapest irons I tried, this is beautifully lightweight at 1.14kg despite having a large 320ml water tank. There are lots of functions such as a non-stick soleplate and a vertical steam option. You also get a generous two-metre cord. But it falls down on the one job I’m paying for — ironing. Although it is supposed to be non-drip, it leaked at low temperatures and left unsightly marks on my silk shirt. 2/5 . VALUE FOR MONEY . Philips PerfectCare Pure Steam Generator, £119.99, robertdyas.co.uk . The nearest rival to the Swan iron and less than half the price, this is fantastic value for a top-range model bursting with extras. I normally dread ironing my grandmother’s thick linen table cloth, but I removed every crease in seconds with no effort. It’s all thanks to the impressive 1.5-litre water reservoir which pumps out high-pressure steam at 110g per minute. And the soleplate is designed so steam is distributed evenly — meaning fewer strokes and speedy ironing. The manufacturer boasts that you never need to change the settings as it creates the perfect temperature level whether you are ironing silk PJs or kids’ jeans. I tried it — and it was true. You also get a five-year guarantee. 5/5 . CORDLESS POWER . Tefal Freemove FV9970, £79.99, johnlewis.com . Tefal is hugely proud of its cordless iron. And with good reason. The base recharges the iron during each rest period, which means there is no cord getting in your way, and the control panel lets you know when you need to recharge. It’s powerful, too — delivering an impressive 180g per minute shot of steam. The handy steam on-demand trigger got rid of stubborn creases in my partner’s shirts. It also has a vertical steam option. I used it to blast away creases in a dress that had been hanging in my wardrobe for too long — much easier than dragging out the ironing board. If you’re happy to pay over the odds to dispense with a cord, this is a great option. 3/5 . TURBO STEAM . Tefal Ultimate Anti-Calc FV9603, £69.99, argos.co.uk . Lots of impressive features here — such as a unit which collects all the limescale from your iron. A turbo steam function delivers a mighty 200g per minute jet of steam and an anti-drip mechanism cuts down on the chances of water leaking. But this iron is too darn heavy: a stonking 1.5kg when empty; once the 350ml tank is full, it’s like lifting a brick. On the plus side, it provides the perfect excuse to hand over the ironing to my partner. 3/5 ."
"(CNN) -- A marine science instructor's late-afternoon snorkel off the Southern California coast last Sunday was first met with shock and soon excitement when she discovered a gigantic oarfish, a deep-sea creature that remains little known to the science world and people outside. Jasmine Santana was about 15 feet underwater when she found the 18-foot-long, silvery fish with reddish fins and eyes the size of a half-dollar staring at her from the sandy bottom. Realizing it was dead, she snatched the fish's tail, and using buoyancy and low tides, powered her way back on shore. ""I was first a little scared,"" said the still-thrilled Santana, who has been working for Catalina Island Marine Institute since January. ""But when I realized it was an oarfish, I knew it was harmless."" Giant eyeball washes up on beach . After a 15-minute swim dragging the 400-pound carcass, she needed help from 14 others to lift the fish out of the water at Toyon Bay, California. ""I was really amazed. It was like seeing something in a dream,"" said Mark Waddington, the senior captain of CIMI's sailing school vessel the ""Tole Mour"" who gave Santana a hand. ""It's the first time I ever witnessed an oarfish this big."" Discovery makes a splash: The rarest whale . ""Oarfish are found in all temperate to tropical waters, but are rarely seen, dead or alive,"" CIMI, a non-profit marine science education group, said in a release. ""It is believed that oarfish dive over 3,000 feet deep, which leaves them largely unstudied, and little is known about their behavior or population."" Waddington, who has been with CIMI since 1994, said it remains unclear why the oarfish was found in shallow water this time, but it appeared to have died naturally. Waddington said while the oarfish's carcass is still being preserved in ice, CIMI has been sending some of its tissues and other samples to marine scientists, including Dr. Milton Love, a fish expert from University of California at Santa Barbara, to study its DNA and diet habits. Waddington said CIMI will likely to keep the fish's skeleton for educational purposes. Its program attracts more than 30,000 school-age children each year.

The video was compiled in 2010 and has gone viral once again this Christmas, already notching up over 800,000 views on YouTube. In one family, the mother asks her son and daughter: ‘What did you want for Christmas more than anything in the whole world?’. When they respond with ‘a puppy’ she teasingly asks ‘and, did you get it?’ Their despondent ‘no’ is enough to melt the stoniest of hearts, as is their unrestrained joy when their father enters with a large box. ‘Santa dropped this off too,’ says the children's mother as the children rip the lid off to reveal a sandy coloured Labrador puppy in a moment that cannot fail to make the viewers smile.

When she opens it to discover a puppy she cries out in delight before pulling the pup into her arms and hugging him to her with a beaming smile on her face, while her family, clearly delighted with her joyous response, can be heard laughing in the background. Not just the children: A grandma is shocked and delighted when she is given a pup by her family . A gift of joy: With the combination of irresistibly cute puppies and joy filled children, few videos online can rival this one for pure feel-good factor . Other scenes see puppies generally being adorable in and around the wrapping paper they have emerged from. The RSPCA urges anyone thinking of purchasing a pet as a Christmas present to consider the long-term commitment required to properly care for an animal. People considering giving a pet for a present should take into account whether the recipient has the time and money to care for the animal 365 days of the year for the next 10-20 years. Factors to consider include daily grooming, feeding and exercise and ongoing costs such as vets bills and registration fees."
"Vandals have decapitated a one-meter tall statue of Mary during an early morning attack on a Catholic church, sparking a police investigation. The Maronite Catholic Church in Punchbowl, in Sydney’s west was targeted at around 5am on Thursday. Vandals attacked glass casing outside the Saint Charbel’s Church on Highclere Avenue, broke the head off the statue of Mary and shattered pieces of a statue of Saint Charbel. It is the second reported attack on the church in the past six months. Vandals have decapitated a one-meter tall statue of Mary (right) at the Saint Charbel’s Church in Sydney . Rev Fr. Joseph Sleiman, Superior of Saint Charbel’s Monastery, was alerted to the vandalism by a parishioner who was in tears . Last October, vandals attempted to break into the church and damage the lights on the grounds. Rev Fr. Joseph Sleiman, Superior of Saint Charbel’s Monastery, was alerted to the vandalism in the early hours of the morning after a parishioner knocked on the monastery doors in tears. ‘The shrine is a symbol of our Christianity, like the crucifix. The space that was damaged is a popular place for private prayer and reflection,’ he said. CCTV footage around the shrine seen by Daily Mail Australia shows what appears to be a man in his twenties or early thirties behaving suspiciously on the church grounds between 4.47am and 5.07am. The suspect appears to stroll around outside of the church, even using the church toilets before making his way to the side of the church where the grotto is situated. CCTV footage shows what appears to be a man in his twenties or early thirties behaving suspiciously on the church grounds between 4.47am and 5.07am . Rev Fr. Sleiman believes the attack was intentional and was committed by an outsider. According to the last Australian census Saint Charbel’s parish consists of over 40,000 Australian Catholic members of Lebanese descent. ‘I do not suspect anyone from our community. We strongly condemn any behavior of this nature to our church and any place of worship. Our Church is a place of worship and prayer that should be respected by all. Our community has been deeply affected and shocked by the attack,’ said Fr. Sleiman. Bishop of Maronite Diocese of Australia, Father Antoine Charbel Tarabay, said that Saint Charbel’s Church has not seen an attack like this since 1973 when the church was first built. Smashed glass was left around the shrine outside the church in Punchbowl in Sydney . ‘The shrine is a symbol of our Christianity, like the crucifix,'Rev Fr. Slemiman told Daily Mail Australia . ‘It’s sad to see that people have the mentality to do this. I’m worried about our Australian values and our freedom of religion,’ he said. Member for Blaxland, Mr David Coleman, was also present during the police investigation told Daily Mail that, ‘any event of vandalism is a real concern and it’s important that it’s fully investigated by the police.’ Rev Fr. Joseph Sleiman said security around the church would be heightened and assures his community that there is no call for anxiety or fear. ‘The authorities are diligently and seriously addressing the matter, and steps have been taken to ensure security of all who use our church.’ A New South Wales Police Force spokesman said the agency is ‘investigating the incident and urges anyone with information that can assist to contact Police.’"

A third of people have no idea that Charles Dickens wrote Great Expectations, a worrying survey of reading habits has revealed . A third of people have no idea who wrote Great Expectations, a worrying survey of reading habits has revealed. One in six were also unable to name the genius behind Hamlet. Dickens and Shakespeare are not the only major authors to fall out of favour with large sections of the population - 28 per cent of adults admitted never having read one of the classics. One in seven revealed they hadn’t read a single book over the past 12 months. The findings suggest not only that many people have managed to complete their education without study any classical literature in detail but that the habit continues into adulthood. Just 12 per cent have read Much Ado About Nothing, 18 per cent Catcher in the Rye and only 26 per cent have picked up Pride and Prejudice - despite its enormous popularity as prime time television drama and in the cinema. A quarter of adults have read fewer than five books over the past year and the average gets through seven, according to the survey of 2,000 people. Half of those who complete fewer than ten books every year blamed lack of time and a quarter said they had more interesting things to do. Around one in eight said they were a slow reader and a similar proportion simply said they didn’t like reading. Bedtime is when most people pick up a book, with just under half finding time when they’re between the sheets. A third catch up on reading while on holiday. Only a quarter said they flick through a few pages whenever they get a chance. The favourite genre is thrillers (30 per cent), followed by crime novels (26 per cent). Romance novels are favoured by 16 per cent - although this comprises 29 per cent of women and just two per cent of men. The most popular book from contemporary literature is the Da Vinci Code, which 36 per cent of people have read. The Harry Potter series came second with 28 per cent. James Endersby, managing director of Opinium Research, which carried out the survey, said: ‘Unfortunately for many people, reading is now a luxury and something which they cannot commit a great deal of time to. ‘Over the summer, many will have taken the opportunity to relax with a good book and have hopefully reminded themselves how much they enjoy reading. What would be great is if everyone decided to pick one classic book to read during the winter months.’ Just 18 per cent have read Catcher in the Rye and only . 26 per cent have picked up Pride and Prejudice - despite its enormous . popularity as prime time television drama and in the cinema . Modular exams have allowed pupils to read sections of books instead of the entire work. But Education Secretary Michael Gove is changing the curriculum and introducing end-of-course exams that will be more rigorous. Secondary school pupils will be required to study at least two Shakespeare plays and a 19th-century novel at GCSE and cover the works of two authors in depth each year. A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘New GCSEs will demand that students read whole texts. ‘The exams’ specification will mean pupils read a wide range of classic literature fluently and in depth, developing their understanding of English literary heritage.’"
"(CNN) -- Women are not powerless. Look at Nigeria. It's impossible not to be outraged by the capture of hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls by a terrorist group, and by the inexcusable delay in pursuing the armed men who took them. For women, in particular, the continuing drama has ignited a particularly powerful response. Women in many countries are vulnerable and victimized, but they are fighting back in unexpected places with the built-up fury of long held frustration. And they are getting results. Women are no longer powerless. Let there be no doubt: The reason the United States is sending help, Nigeria is accepting it and the entire world is paying attention is that the women of Nigeria demanded it. Nigerian women from the town of Chibok in the northeastern Borno state, the mothers, sisters, relatives and friends of the schoolgirls, launched their protests and set off the #BringBackOurGirls campaign that swept away weeks of international apathy. At a rally in Abuja, one woman held up a sign that read ""Can Anyone Hear Me?"" The long-delayed answer was a most emphatic ""Yes,"" which resonated across the oceans and echoed in the Nigerian presidential palace. Sure, the decisions are mostly up to male politicians, but in Washington, all the women members of the Senate, 20 of them, signed a letter to the president of the United States demanding a firm response. They did it without hesitation and without regard to political affiliation. The tragedy of the Nigerian girls was grotesquely highlighted in a video by a laughing Abubakr Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram. He declared ""Allah says I should sell. He commands me to sell. I will sell women."" The revolting message encapsulated the distilled essence of women's plight in many corners of the world. And the response shows a phenomenon of both spontaneous and organized pushback from women's groups, from the millions of men who join them, and from the forces that social media can unleash across cyberspace. It is a movement that begins with the grassroots, moves into cyberspace and powers its way into the halls of power. Women have had enough. There is a reason that Malala Yousefzai has become a major international figure, a hero especially to women. It is, of course, about her bravery. Gunmen belonging to the Pakistani Taliban boarded the bus that was bringing the 14-year-old champion of girls' education and her friends from school. They shot her in the face. The Taliban oppose girls' education with that obsessive fervor displayed by the most radical Islamist groups, who want to take all Muslims back to the 7th century. They could not kill her and they could no silence her. Instead, they made her stronger, and they made her voice louder. In Afghanistan, when the Taliban came to power, one of its first acts was to shut down women's schools and ban women from universities. They did it under the guise of enforcing Islamic rules. Religious pretexts are common. But they are nothing more than an excuse. Like the Taliban, Boko Haram finds it particularly offensive that girls should receive an education. Shenkau appears on the latest video holding his AK-47, offering his considered advice. ""Girls should go and get married,"" he said, adding he would give them in marriage ""at the age of 9""...at the age of 12, ""because they are our slaves."" It's no wonder frustration is boiling over. Consider the recent news from Indonesia's Aceh province, where a woman was raped by eight men as punishment for having an affair. Now an official Shariah court has sentenced her to a humiliating public caning. Women are fed up. And it's not all about the work of Muslim extremists. In late 2012, emotions boiled over in India after the horrific gang rape of a student riding a city bus in Mumbai. The woman came to be known as Nirbhaya, which means ""the fearless one,"" in Hindi. Nirbhaya, who had left home to study physiotherapy, had plans to show the Indian people that a woman could realize her dreams. She was planning to give free health care to the poor. Instead, she died at 23, when six men on the bus she took with her boyfriend attacked her with such brutality that she died from internal injuries. Nirbhaya shook India's women. She jolted the country. In massive demonstrations Indian women joined by thousands of men demanded the government take action to stop the epidemic of rape. The world was horrified. The government vowed to act, but there is much left to be done in a country dominated by men on all spheres of society. Women endure the brunt of the worst aspects of repression and exploitation. As many as 30 million people are slaves today. Most of them are sex slaves working in brothels and enduring other forms of captivity. And 98% of the sex slaves are women and girls. Cases like the Nigerian girls, still unaccounted for, and millions sold into bondage are the most urgent, the most dramatic. But they are only a part of the problem. They are so outrageous, so offensive, that they leave no room for moral equivocation. Just a few days ago, the world was barely paying attention to Nigeria's abducted schoolgirls. Today, the whole world is watching, help is on the way. That is what the women of Nigeria have accomplished -- not quite what Boko Haram had in mind."
"(CNN) -- We all like to think medical care is about science, but too often it's about professional interests. Last week, a 25-year follow-up of the Canadian National Breast Screening Study was published -- one of the eight major randomized trials of screening mammography. The headline was simple: Mammogram screenings don't reduce cancer death rates. The reaction by some American mammographers was predictable -- discredit the study. It's predictable because it is exactly what they did when they didn't like the first findings of the study published more than 20 years ago. The effort by the American College of Radiology to discredit the Canadian trial relies on two allegations: . The investigators were cheating: Let's look at the background on this. Randomized trials are a critical tool for clinical researchers. Study participants are placed at random in either one group (in this case those who get mammograms) or the other (those who do not). Who is in which group is solely based on the play of chance -- a flip of a coin. The allegation of cheating -- purposely putting women whom researchers knew had advanced cancers in the mammography group -- is an incredibly serious one. It sure was taken seriously by Canada's National Cancer Institute. It launched a two-year independent review of the entire randomization process. In 1997, the review found no credible evidence of cheating. But that didn't stop the allegation from being trotted out last week. The new study provides evidence that randomization did exactly what it is supposed to do: It created two identical groups of women. The rate of death in the two groups was exactly the same, every year, for 25 years. That can't happen by cheating -- that can only happen when the groups are formed solely by chance. Canada is a Third World country: More specifically, the Canadians used old mammography machines that produced inadequate images, interpreted by inadequate mammographers. It sounded as if Canada were Botswana, as if the nation had only recently gotten electric power and was still struggling to train doctors. For mammographers who need to point to the benefits demonstrated by earlier trials of mammography, this is an odd allegation. Why? Because the other trials used even older technology. In fact, one of the trials most favorable to screening -- the Health Insurance Plan of New York's -- dates from two decades before Canada's, in the early 1960s, when mammography technologies were primitive. Yet, in both New York and Canada, outmoded technology did exactly what it was supposed to do. It found small breast cancers. Armed with these two allegations, the mammographers followed a well-worn strategy: Make the allegations often and loudly enough and maybe they will stick. To be clear, not all mammographers share this view. A new generation has openly acknowledged the problems of mammography. But many in the old guard are more likely to attack any suggestion that screening doesn't work as well as advertised, characterizing researchers who raise the possibility as ""malicious"" or ""dangerous"" and questioning the editorial policies of the journals that publish their work. It's time to stop the unfounded allegations. It might be standard procedure for politics but not for science. Too much energy has been devoted to discrediting the Canadian study and not enough to understanding it. To make sense of information the Canadian trial offers, you need to understand its unique design -- specifically what is being compared with what. Most of the other randomized trials simply compared regular mammography with doing nothing. In the Canadian trial, one group received a regular physical exam of the breast -- a very careful exam performed by specially trained nurses. The other group received the same regular physical exam plus regular mammography. In other words, the trial tested the usefulness of adding mammography to a physical exam in an effort to detect abnormalities that are too small to feel. And the trial showed that finding these ""too small to feel"" abnormalities doesn't help women live longer. That's really important information. It doesn't mean that mammography can't help at all -- it is extremely challenging to standardize a physical exam of the breast across an entire population. It does mean, however, that if we are going to do mammography, we should be using it to find big, important things -- not small, unimportant things. Further, the Canadian trial confirms that the harm of being overdiagnosed by screening mammography is real: One in five invasive cancers found by screening represents overdiagnosis. Overdiagnosis happens when cellular abnormalities meet the pathologic definition of ""cancer,"" yet never progress to cause clinical disease. Overdiagnosed women are told they have cancer, are treated for cancer, yet their ""cancer"" is not destined to cause them any problems. It is important to recognize this estimate doesn't include the smallest, earliest form of breast cancer found only by mammography -- ductal carcinoma in situ or DCIS. If overdiagnosis is a problem in invasive cancer, you can imagine it might be a greater problem for a smaller, earlier form of cancer. Even mammography's old guard objects to having DCIS included in estimates of the amount of overdiagnosis. Why do they object? Because so much of DCIS represents overdiagnosis, including it makes the estimate even higher. It's time to get the science back in screening mammography and to recognize that mammographers may not be the ideal source for balanced information. It's too much like asking the dentists for balanced information about routine dental X-rays. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of H. Gilbert Welch."

"(CNN) -- A surveillance video of 8-year-old Sandra Cantu, missing since March 27, shows the child in the mobile home park where she lives, skipping and happily swinging her arms on the day she disappeared in Tracy, California. A surveillance video shows Sandra Cantu skipping in the mobile home park where she lives. The grainy scene appears for about eight seconds before she disappears from view. Police Lt. Jeremy Watney showed the clip Saturday at a news conference, but offered no details. ""I can't get into specifics of where it came from. That's all part of the investigation,"" he said. ""The CD will show you exactly how she looked on that particular day when she went missing."" In the video, the girl emerges from a pathway at the Orchard Estates Mobile Home Park into what appears to be an alley. To her right is the corner of what looks like a wooden deck; there seem to be deep shadows on the left. Watney said authorities initially thought Sandra was carrying a purse or backpack, but the images turned out to be shadows. He said authorities have ""hundreds of hours of videotapes"" in the case. The day the child disappeared, she came home from school, kissed her mother and left to play with a friend who lives a couple of homes away. A short time later, she left that home to go to another friend's home, according to a spokeswoman for her family. She was reported missing about 8 p.m. Sandra was wearing a pink Hello Kitty T-shirt and black leggings. Watney said the reward for information leading to her whereabouts has increased to $26,000, and authorities are following more than 800 leads. More than 300 trained searchers from 17 agencies were out on Saturday. A door-to-door canvass moved outside of the park Saturday afternoon as police continued to collect details from residents in the area. Watney said police executed search warrants on a home, a vehicle and a person Friday, but nobody has been detained in the case. ""It's just looking for clues and evidence"" he said of the warrants. Watney said the reward for information leading to her whereabouts has increased to $26,000, and authorities are following more than 900 leads. Over 300 trained searchers from 17 agencies were out on Saturday. On Monday night, Tracy police and FBI agents searched six locations, some in the Orchard Estates Mobile Home Park and some in Tracy. All of the places were connected to two men who live in the mobile home park, officials said. Authorities have not called the men suspects and have not named them publicly. They did not say how or if they might be related to the case. Police have said they do not believe Sandra ran away. The girl's aunt, Angie Chavez, told CNN Headline News' Nancy Grace that Sandra's father lives in Mexico and was not around the day she disappeared. Tracy is about 60 miles east of San Francisco."

So pet lovers, who like their pal to eat as good as they do, watch this space, you could soon be dining together with your furry friend from a restaurant near you. Delivery Hero has plans to expand 'Doggy Bag' beyond the 8 Sydney restaurants to right across Sydney and eventually nationally . All meals are specifically made for pets and low in seasoning . Delivery Hero launched Doggy Bag in October ."
"THE MAGIC AND MYSTERY OF BIRDS By Noah Strycker (Souvenir Press £18) Last week’s news that half the world’s wild animals have disappeared in the past 40 years should depress and anger every right-thinking person. It’s not just exotic species we should be mourning, but British birds such as the corn bunting and the northern lapwing. Needless to say, it’s all the fault of humankind — greedy, selfish, short-sighted and thoughtless as ever. The albatross, for example, is on the verge of extinction because too often when it dives for fish it snares itself instead on the hook at the end of fishing long-lines. If you think this isn’t your business, you couldn’t be more wrong. Ornithologist Noah Strycker’s illuminating — and, actually, rather moving — new book is a welcome reminder that we have much more to learn from the animal kingdom than we can even begin to know. There are parallels between ourselves and birds: reproduction, movements, daily rhythms, communication, navigation and intelligence . Asking searching questions about why birds behave as they do, he offers poetic insights into our own existence. A bird-lover since childhood and now a world-renowned ornithologist, he lists many ways in which there are parallels between ourselves and birds: reproduction, movements, daily rhythms, communication, navigation and intelligence. And he demonstrates how much better human society might be if we took the lessons of the birds to heart. Birds find their way naturally, by means of methods humans have had to discover and invent, like starlings . Anybody who watched the extraordinary television series that attached cameras to birds in flight will be well aware of their miraculous abilities to wing their way across oceans and through storms, yet still land in the right place. Birds find their way naturally, by means of methods humans have had to discover and invent, including magnetic fields, polarised light, echoes, ‘map’-reading, and infrasound. Strycker sounds proud when he writes: ‘You can blindfold a bird, cover its nostrils, cover its ears, transport it far from home in a magnetised cage and, more often than not, it will still manage to find its way home.’ After describing those magnificent movements of murmurations of starlings (like great, sweeping skeins of smoke), he concludes that explanation takes us beyond mere science. To him, the beauty of the bird movement is as beyond scientific analysis as a Renaissance masterpiece — and the miracle of seemingly pointless beauty is itself a lesson. As one critic has correctly pointed out, Strycker has the mind of a biologist, yet he writes like a poet. And what he has to tell us is fascinating. Unlike most mountain birds, which migrate south in the winter, the American nutcracker (similar to a woodpecker) not only stays put but actually lays its eggs during the brutal snowstorms of January and February. How does it survive? By stocking up. Nutcrackers live on pine seeds, which they begin gathering in July, when pine cones first ripen, and continue harvesting until early winter. Carrying about a hundred seeds at a time in a special pouch under their tongue, they hide them under the soil in numerous locations in batches of just three or four. And this, as Strycker notes, ‘is where nutcrackers transcend mere survival’. In just one season, a single nutcracker may store tens of thousands of pine seeds in as many as 5,000 different mini-caches. They don’t mark the spots where the seeds are hidden; indeed by the time they come to find them, the ground is often covered by snow. It’s an astonishing feat, achieved, as various experiments have proved, by them noting the landmarks near each cache. The Australian fairy-wrens, with diminutive with violet crowns and long, shimmering blue tails, are all related to each other . And then there are the Australian fairy-wrens, diminutive with violet crowns and long, shimmering blue tails. Strycker spent months observing them in a six-mile stretch of creek and discovered they were all related to each other, ‘a sprawling family of a hundred siblings, uncles, cousins, grandparents and occasional newcomers’ who all took care of each other’s young — proving humans are not the only species capable of altruism. These are just some of the intriguing topics in this book. The most moving chapter is about the albatross — the romantic, majestic bird of the freezing wastelands which can have a wingspan of 12ft and fly for 2,000 miles to pick up food for their hungry chicks. Yet even though they spend interminable amounts of time on the wing, this beautiful creature mates for life. Twenty years after the first famous dancing courtship ritual (when they face each other, stretching huge wings while they dip and canoodle) they will be nesting with the same partner. The author comments: ‘Personally I think albatrosses feel love even more intensely than we do, and available evidence seems to back me up. The Nazca booby is unusual in the bird world as it is known for routinely slaughtering its own siblings in the nest . ‘No matter what category of affection you study, albatrosses beat us every time.’ Don’t forget that only about 5 per cent of the world’s 5,000 mammal species are socially monogamous. Strycker points out that about 40 per cent of new human marriages in the U.S. will end in divorce, ‘which places us on about the same level as the Nazca booby, a type of seabird known for . . . routinely slaughtering its own siblings in the nest.’ But albatrosses stay faithful and are good parents: ‘When they commit they quit the singles scene’ and ‘spend less time dancing and more time raising their chicks’. Do you see what I mean about us needing to learn lessons from the birds? In this, the last chapter, Strycker reaches new heights of beauty and imagination when he describes what he has seen — an albatross pair sleeping with the head of one bird pillowed on the breast of another, or tenderly caressing each other’s heads. I love that one of the world’s leading ornithologists can write: ‘Different people report seeing various things deep in the inky-black eyes of the albatross — wisdom, serenity, wilderness, peace, endurance — which are well and good, but all I see is love.’ For centuries, we have considered ourselves superior to all the other creatures who share this planet. Remote from nature, we think we know everything and exploit the members of the animal kingdom as our inferiors. But writers such as Strycker remind us that, in many ways, they are more complete and more gifted — extraordinary and complex nations of their own, moving to an unseen music that we will never be able to hear."

"By . Associated Press . and Alex Greig . Police and the FBI are searching for two young Detroit siblings after their 27-year-old mother was found shot to death in a vacant house about six miles from her home. The Wayne County medical examiner's office says an autopsy Tuesday determined Alicia Fox had been shot twice in the head. Her body was badly decomposed. Detroit police spokesman Officer Adam Madera says Fox had been missing for several weeks. A family member found her body Monday night in the basement of the abandoned house after getting a tip from an 'unknown person.' Body found: Alicia Fox's decomposing body was found in an abandoned house in Detroit . The Detroit Free Press reports that Michael Fields, Fox's uncle, found her body covered in blankets in a boarded up home on the 6800 block of Penrod St. Neighbors said they last saw Fox and her children around Memorial Day at their home in northwest Detroit. Missing are six-year-old Kaylah Hunter and eight-month-old brother, Kristian Justice. Police are also trying to locate the father of the baby boy, 28-year-old Erin Justice. Write caption here . Horrific discovery: Alicia Fox was reported missing on June 6 and last seen late May, before her body was found in the basement of this house .

Nick Clegg might have power as Deputy Prime Minister but it seems being a self-confessed 'major devotee' of Marks and Spencer was not enough to prevent a fresh slump in clothing sales at the high street retailer. The Lib Dem leader surprised listeners to his radio phone-in when he revealed he buys his underpants and socks from M&S during a discussion about another poor set of sales figures. But he also gave an indication of why the firm might be in trouble when he asked on air: 'Do you go to M&S for fashion?' Scroll down for video . Sales slunmp: Marks & Spencer said sales in its clothing and homeware division fell for the seventh straight quarter. M&S today posted its . seventh straight quarterly fall in non-food sales today, as the group . failed to show any improvement in its range of clothing and homewares. Asked about the figures on LBC 97.3, Mr Clegg gave a bit too much away: 'Oh I am a major devotee of Marks & Spencer’s clothing, particularly some articles which I normally wouldn’t talk about on a family radio programme. 'No I was thinking to myself I’m going to go out and buy some extra pairs of socks.' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg ssaid he did not think people went to M&S for fashion . However, he also cast doubt on whether M&S's fortunes can be revived with a focus on high-end fashion. 'Well I think it’s a great store.  I heard on the radio this morning them saying that they’re not doing well with fashion items, but I’ve never thought of… do you go to M&S for fashion?  You go to M&S for sort of value for money clothing and I’m not the greatest fashion commercial.' The 129 year-old retailer, which has . become the subject of takeover speculation in recent months, said sales . at its non-food division at stores open over a year fell 3.8 per cent in . the 13 weeks to March 30, its fiscal fourth quarter. The figures were slightly . better than expected. But . M&S, which serves 21million customers a week from over 700 British . stores, had to again rely on strong food sales to support overall . growth. Chief executive Marc Bolland is under pressure to recover M&S's clothing performance after a poor 2012 and disappointing Christmas sales. He has previously warned a new general . merchandise management team led by John Dixon, the former boss of food, . will not make a major impact on sales until M&S launches its . autumn/winter collections in July. But the 3.8 per cent fall in non-food sales was still better than many in the City had expected. Most City analysts had forecast a fall of 4.6 per cent and a revised fall of 3.8 per cent in the third quarter as M&S moved to protect its profit margins by offering fewer discounts in the run up to Christmas. M&S shares were trading 3.6 per cent higher at 397.6p in London following the release of the results. They closed yesterday at 384p, valuing the business at £6.1 billion. Last month M&S shares hit a 28-month high after a newspaper report that the Gulf state of Qatar was planning a bid. A source close to state-owned Qatar Holding denied the report, but speculation of possible private equity interest has persisted. ‘The fourth quarter wasn't as bad as some had expected,’ said James McGregor, director of the retail consultants, Retail Remedy. 'General merchandise is clearly still struggling but these numbers will buy Marc Bolland a few more months. Judgement Day for Marc Bolland will come later this year.’ The trading update also encouraged Sheridan Admans, investment research manager at The Share Centre to rate M&S shares as a ‘buy’. ‘The turnaround of its clothing operation is key to the chief executive keeping his job and we believe that it is tackling the problems in its women’s wear and general merchandise operations. In response to investors, the chief executive has drawn a line in the sand with the expectation of delivering better performance by the autumn, as the retailer prepares to re-vitalise its clothing ranges, Mr Admans said. ‘Investors may be encouraged to see Marks & Spencer post the fastest quarterly sales growth in almost two years.’ Food sales on the same basis rose 4 per cent versus analyst forecasts of an increase of 1.9-3.5 per cent and a third quarter rise of 0.3 per cent. Total UK like-for-like sales rose 0.6 per cent. ‘We are working hard on improving our performance in general merchandise and, despite difficult trading conditions, we made progress in our operational execution,’ Bolland said. ‘In January we said we expect the pressure on consumers' disposable incomes to continue throughout 2013. As a result we were cautious about the outlook for the year ahead and this view remains unchanged.’ British retailers are facing difficult times as consumers has been curtailed by worries over job security and a squeeze on incomes. About two-thirds of Britain’s economic growth comes from consumer spending. M&S’s trading update reflected sentiment elsewhere on the high street. A survey earlier this week  said growth in underlying British retail sales slowed last month despite a boost from an early Easter, as unseasonably cold weather hurt demand for summer clothes and shoes. Last month, Next reported slower trading conditions since the beginning of February. Department store Debenhams issued a profit warning, blaming January snow."
"By . Daniel Martin . 'Ugliest side of Ukip': Gerard Batten, a London MEP and Ukip spokesman on immigration was criticised for comments which 'overlap with the far-Right' A senior Ukip politician plunged his party into fresh controversy last night after calling on Muslims to sign a special code of conduct to prove they reject violence. Gerard Batten, a London MEP and the party’s spokesman on immigration, said it was a big mistake for Europe to allow ‘an explosion of mosques across their land’. The comments will heap further pressure on leader Nigel Farage, who has vowed to rid his party of what he called ‘Walter Mitty’ types. Last month he was forced to suspend a town councillor who suggested that the country was suffering floods because of David Cameron’s gay marriage policy. Mr Farage also had to get rid of another MEP, Godfrey Bloom, after he called some women ‘sluts’ and warned against sending aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’. Last night critics attacked the latest comments from Mr Batten, a member of the party’s executive, saying they represented the ‘ugliest side of Ukip’ and 'overlap with the far-Right'. The MEP told The Guardian that he stood by his call for a ‘charter of Muslim understanding’, which he first suggested in 2006. The document asks Muslims to sign a declaration rejecting violence and says that certain parts of the Koran that promote ‘violent physical Jihad’ should be regarded as ‘inapplicable, invalid and non-Islamic’. Asked on Tuesday about the charter, Mr Batten said he had written it with a friend, who is an Islamic scholar, and could not see why ‘any reasonable, normal person’ would object to signing it. He also repeated his view that some Muslim texts need updating, claiming some say ‘kill Jews wherever you find them and various things like that’. ‘If that represents the thinking of modern people, there’s something wrong, in which case maybe they need to revise their thinking,’ he said. ‘If they say they cannot revise their thinking on those issues, then who’s got the problem - us or them?’ Asked why Muslims have been singled out, rather than followers of other faiths like Christians or Jews, Mr Batten said: ‘Christians aren’t blowing people up at the moment, are they? Are there any bombs going off round the world which are claimed by Christian organisations? I don’t think so.’ In an interview four years ago, Mr Batten also proposed a ban on new mosques across Europe, suggested Muslim countries should not be ‘appeased’ and warned of the threats of having ‘two incompatible systems living in the same place at the same time’. Mr Batten is top of the party’s MEP candidate list for London, having passed a round of psychometric testing to make sure his views were acceptable. He is also a former candidate for London mayor. Muslims celebrate Eid ul-Fitr in London: Mr . Batten is asking Muslims to sign a declaration rejecting violence and . saying that parts of the Koran that promote 'violent physical Jihad' should be regarded as 'inapplicable' Asked yesterday whether he still believed Muslims should sign the charter, Batten said: ‘I don’t suppose the Pope would disagree with it or the Archbishop of Canterbury or anybody else. ‘So why should they feel aggrieved that they might be asked to sign. They don’t have to. If they don’t believe in those five points, they don’t have to sign it.’ In the 2010 interview, Mr Batten suggests a ban on new mosques in ‘our cities’ and warns it was wrong to have allowed so many already. ‘They don’t allow Christian churches or Hindu temples to be built or any kind of non-Muslim place of worship in many of their countries and certainly not in the heartland of their religion,’ he said. ‘Well, if they don’t allow it, why can they expect to see their religion tolerated somewhere else?’ Last night Rehman Chishti, Tory MP for Gillingham and Rainham, said Mr Batten’s position was ‘shocking’. ‘If Nigel Farage had any credibility, he would quite clearly not allow this individual to stand for office in Ukip,’ he said. Sadiq Khan, Labour’s shadow London minister, also said he was ‘appalled at the ignorance that Gerard Batten appears to have shown when speaking about the faith that I and hundreds of thousands of British Muslims practice’. Mary Honeyball, a Labour MEP for London, said Batten ‘represents the ugliest side of Ukip’. ‘Batten’s views overlap with the far-right,’ she said. ‘The idea that Muslims should be singled out in the way he suggests is a relic from a darker, more prejudiced time.’"

Francois Hollande was due to hold crisis talks with Indian steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal today after Boris Johnson encouraged him to give up France and move to Britain. The London Mayor accused the Socialist government in Paris of acting like working class revolutionaries - or 'sans culottes' - after telling Mittal, one of the richest men in the world, to get out of their country. On Monday, President Hollande's industry minister Arnaud Montebourg accused Mr Mittal's company, ArcelorMittal, of 'lying' and 'blackmail' and suggested he left, along with his 20,000 jobs.

French Socialist Party sources today said they were furious by Mr Johnson's intervention, saying he had 'completely missed the point' of Mr Montebourg's words. 'He was not attacking a company for being in France, but for treating workers so badly,' one source told the Evening Standard. 'The idea was that countries like France should have some control over the decisions of international business people. In these circumstances, Mr Johnson's intervention was most unwelcome.'

"Washington (CNN) -- Republicans in Washington say they are breathing a sigh of relief now that the Kansas secretary of state has ruled that the Democratic Senate candidate will stay on the ballot in November even though he dropped out. It's a case of political whiplash for national Republicans, who just hours earlier scrambled to send strategists to Kansas when it suddenly became a head-to-head race between incumbent Republican Pat Roberts and an independent candidate with libertarian views, who would likely pull GOP votes from Roberts. The matchup appeared to make it harder for the GOP to seize the Senate majority. Now a GOP strategist tells CNN that Republicans believe keeping Democrat Chad Taylor on the ballot is ""enormous"" because he was only getting 30% of the vote when he was actively campaigning. Republicans predict the Democrat will still get about 10-25% of the vote on Election Day, making it easier for Roberts to beat independent candidate Greg Orman. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which works to get Republicans elected to the Senate, was already dispatching veteran GOP strategist Chris LaCivita to Kansas, a GOP source tells CNN. The source called it just the first move to try to help bolster Roberts' campaign, which national Republicans worry is lackluster and ill-equipped to run an unexpectedly competitive campaign. Republicans had also enlisted help from former Sen. Bob Dole, the longtime senator from Kansas and a former Senate majority leader, who was already scheduled in the state this week. A source close to Dole tells CNN he is playing the role as ""super consultant"" to Roberts, an old friend. The Senate race in Kansas just got more interesting . 5 Senate races to watch in 2014 . Republicans were moving fast because of the national importance of the race in the GOP quest to regain control of the Senate in November. The GOP has to pick up six seats to take over the Senate. Their advantage has been that they are only playing defense in two states: Kentucky and Georgia. Adding Kansas to the list has many implications, most immediately with money. After 30 years in Senate, McConnell tries to run as 'candidate of change' Republican resources are already spread thin because there are so many neck-and-neck races where they are spending campaign cash -- mostly where they are playing offense trying to pick up Democratic seats everywhere from Louisiana to Alaska to North Carolina and New Hampshire and beyond. When Roberts narrowly won a GOP primary race earlier this year, Republicans thought he would have relatively smooth sailing towards re-election. Kansas is so conservative, it has only been represented by Republican senators for three quarters of a century. U.S. Chamber ramps up efforts in key N.C. Senate race . But then Orman began to climb in the polls. The three-way race was already making things tougher for Roberts, but on Wednesday night, Taylor abruptly withdrew, paving the way for a head to head matchup between Roberts and Orman, an independent running on a libertarian platform. Republican strategists tell CNN they had to drag Roberts over the finish line for his GOP primary race, and they hope he understands that he has to work harder than before to win re-election."
"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . We hardly ever think about it, but the Earth we’re standing on rotates at around 1,100 miles per hour (1,670 km/h). But what if that rotation suddenly stopped? That's what Michael Stevens, also known as Vsauce on YouTube, set out to answer with his latest video. The London-based scientist has outlined the devastating impact that a sudden halt to the Earth’s rotation would have on life as we know it. Scroll down for video . Michael Stevens, also known as Vsauce on YouTube, has described what would happen if Earth stopped turning. The gravity of the still Earth is the strongest at the polar regions (shown in green). It is intermediate in the middle latitudes and weakest at the high altitudes of the Andes, close to the equator . Everything would be launched in a ballistic trajectory - around 1,100 mph (1,670 km/h). Those who are somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to content with, which could destroy everything in their path. Meanwhile, Earth’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation. The Earth would become an almost perfect sphere, as the current rotational velocity causes the Earth to bulge out around its equator. On perfect sphere Earth, the world’s oceans would redistribute, flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water. If the Earth stopped spinning, it would take 365 days for the Sun to move through the sky and return to the same position. If the Earth stopped spinning suddenly, the atmosphere would still be in motion with the Earth's original 1,100 mile per hour (1,670 km/h) rotation speed at the equator. Stevens describes how most people would die a horrific death. ‘Immediately everything that wasn’t on Earth and wasn’t safely at the poles would continue to moving as it had,’ he explains. ‘It would be flung due east at 1000mph…Your body would immediately become a 9inch calibre bullet.’ Those who were somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to contend with, which could destroy everything in their path. ‘Gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface and up into the sky forming worldwide storms of unprecedented magnitude,’ continued Mr Stevens. ‘The friction alone, caused by the now stopped Earth colliding with these winds would be enough to cause massive fires and unparalleled erosion’. Meanwhile, Earth’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation. The Earth would become an almost perfect sphere, as the current rotational velocity causes the Earth to bulge out around its equator. Because of the Earth’s bulge in the middle, the oceans are held out at the equator by 5 miles (8 km). On a perfect sphere Earth, the world’s oceans would redistribute, flooding many areas of the planet with a huge volume of water. Those who are somehow able to survive turning into 'supersonic tumbleweed' would have powerful winds to contend with, which could destroy everything in their path. ‘Gusts of wind as fast as those near an atomic bomb detonation would blast past the surface,’ explained Stevens . If the Earth’s rotation slowed to one every 365 days, a condition called 'sun synchronous', every spot in the Earth would have permanent daytime or night-time all year long. This is similar to the situation on the moon where for two weeks the front-side is illuminated by the sun, and for two weeks the back side is illuminated. If it stopped spinning completely, the world would have half a year daylight, and half a year night time. ‘The yearly change in the sun's position in the sky would now be just its seasonal motion up and down the sky towards the south due to the orbit of the Earth and its axial tilt,’ Nasa said. ‘As you moved along constant lines of Earth latitude, you would see the elevation of the sun increase or decrease in the sky just as we now see the elevation of the sun change from a single point on the Earth due to the Earth's daily rotation.’ But while this may sound horrific, according to Nasa, the probability for such an event is ‘practically zero’ in the next few billion years. Earth’s magnetic field would cease to exist and we would be dosed with deadly amounts of ionising radiation ."

"Jose Mourinho criticised Newcastle's ball boys and accused them of wasting time after Chelsea's 2-1 defeat at St James' Park on Saturday. Mourinho, who is yet to taste a league victory at Newcastle in his two stints as Chelsea boss, felt his side were unfortunate to lose and suggested the Magpies employed time-wasting tactics to get over the line. Papiss Cisse came off the bench to score both goals in the second half, and Didier Drogba's late header wasn't enough to prevent Chelsea from falling to their first defeat of the season. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho remonstrates with fourth official Robert Madley . Mourinho lets off a rise smile as his team were beaten for the first time this season on Saturday . 'No complaints. Unlucky,' he said. 'We had a lot of chances to score in the first half, we didn't. In the second half again we had chances, we didn't (score). 'They defend and the first time they were there (in attack) they score a goal. After that, everybody (got) behind (the ball) against a team that tried everything and a team (in which) every player went to the last seconds. 'We wanted to play more football but it was not possible because a few things I thought didn't belong any more to top-level football but still belongs - the ball disappeared, the ball doesn't come, another ball comes, the ball boys run away - these kind of situations that unfortunately are still part of the game. But no complaints.' Papiss Cisse came off the bench to score both goals for the home side in their win . Chelsea fell to their first Premier League defeat in 15 games this season . Nemanja Matic could make an immediate return after suspension for Chelsea's Champions League clash with Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday. Chelsea boss Mourinho allowed Matic to enjoy a 'holiday' while forced to sit out Saturday's defeat. Serbia midfielder Matic lost his record of starting all Chelsea's Barclays Premier League games after picking up his fifth booking of the season in the 3-0 victory over Tottenham. Mourinho could well rotate his squad for Sporting's Stamford Bridge visit, with Chelsea already assured of top spot in Group G and safe passage to the last 16. John Terry looks on helpless after Cisse scores the second goal for Newcastle . 'He has a little bit of a holiday, a free weekend that he deserves very, very much: and he will come back stronger,' said Mourinho of Matic. 'If one player has a free weekend for example, obviously he is ready to play again three or four more matches in a row. 'I keep saying that I think it's very, very difficult for a player to play every game in December. 'So if we have eight matches, I would say the maximum a player can play is seven.'

"A high school class in Germany has apologised after teenage pupils allegedly started greeting each other with 'Heil Hitler' and communicating in Nazi slogans. The children of class 9a said sorry for their actions on Facebook after intense pressure from parents and staff at the school, in Leipzig in east Germany - but claimed that not all of them were involved. It comes after it emerged that all 29 members of the class - including a Jewish boy - subscribed to a WhatsApp chatroom where Hitler and the Nazis were routinely praised. Horrific: A photograph of one of the male students in class 9A at the Landsberg School near Leipzig, east Germany, shows him raising his right arm in a Nazi salute . The Landsberg Gymnasiums students said: 'We, as class 9a from the Landsberg Grammar School, apologise for everything that has been published which has caused our school damage, and that which is still to come. 'These were ill considered actions which we are not able to make up for. 'Furthermore, it was not the whole class which was responsible. That's why we would like to apologise, even to our uninvolved classmates.' They accused the BILD newspaper in Germany, which broke the story, of 'twisting' facts 'but want to apologise for these anyway, even if they were not meant seriously. And we promise that never again will there be such behaviour in the class of 9a again.' It was signed on behalf of 'all those responsible'. Parents and authorities were left horrified after it emerged that some of the 14 and 15-year-olds had been swapping Nazi sayings and slogans throughout the school day. Local media reports suggested students regularly made anti-Jewish slurs on the messaging app, while praising Hitler as a 'great man'. Fear: Parents are in shock after media reports that students in the class, boys and girls ages 14 and 15, appear to have been engaging in the behaviour on WhatsApp . One of the messages from a student made a Holocaust joke that read: 'Why did Hitler kill himself? The Jews sent him the gas bill.' Two youngsters - believed to be the ringleaders - are now under intense police scrutiny after they stuck on fake Hitler moustaches and were photographed giving the Nazi salute inside school classrooms. The school is currently closed for the autumn half term but police detectives, psychologists, educationalists and parents are set for stormy meetings there with the headmaster in a week's time when it reopens. The praise of, or display of, Nazism and its symbols is strictly forbidden in Germany and first offences can carry a maximum prison term of six months. Police want to determine whether the pro-Nazi sentiments expressed by the youngsters were merely a form of teen rebellion or if they went deeper. Disgusting: Screen grabs from the WhatsApp conversations see students using the 'Sieg Heil' phrase . Photos of 14 and 15-year-old students show them giving Nazi salutes and wearing Hitler moustaches . Gampel, the former head of the local Halle Jewish Community, said his son had experienced harassment at the school. 'My son told me that someone had stuck a far-right NPD [National Democratic Party] sticker on his jacket. It was well known, it seems, that he was Jewish.' 'I have made a formal complaint with police for an investigation, but on the other hand it would definitely be the wrong thing to simply accuse the entire class and tar them with the same brush.' He said: 'Even after I read about it, I found it difficult to get him to talk about what went on. It was only through a lengthy discussion that he admitted what was in the newspaper article was essentially true.' A spokesman for the state educational affairs minister in Saxony-Anhalt said: 'I am shocked. If this is true there can only be one way forward here: zero tolerance.' The WhatsApp exchanges have been handed over to police and prosecutors. In shock: The school, Landsberg Gymnasiums near Leipzig, where the teenagers all study . The school headmaster Lutz Feudel said the entire school had been shocked, and that the secret Nazi sympathisers were confined to one class. Getting to the bottom of how it happened would be difficult because the autumn break had already started, he said. He said the parents of two of the children involved had been invited to a discussion together with their children, but that a third who they wanted to speak to was on holiday in Spain. He said he did not want to instantly accuse the children, saying: 'Breaking taboos is part of young adulthood. I don't believe that they wanted to actively promote neo-Nazi ideology.' All the class students, like all children in Germany, have visited a Nazi concentration camp and regularly learn about the excesses of the Third Reich in classes. Neo-Nazi groups significantly stepped up their recruitment of children in recent years. The state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern near Berlin has started carrying out background checks on would-be kindergarten employees after it was discovered several had been infiltrated by far-right females."

"By . Emma Innes . PUBLISHED: . 07:33 EST, 5 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:38 EST, 5 September 2013 . A little boy given just days to live when he was born four months prematurely is starting school today. Owen Piper weighed just 1lb 9oz when he was born and his head was a small as an egg. His parents, Hayley and Craig, were told he was unlikely to survive for more than 72 hours. Owen Piper (pictured with his mother, Hayley Piper, 29) was born four months prematurely weighing just 1lb 9oz. His parents were told that he would probably not survive for more than a few days . But after 17 weeks in intensive care he pulled through and has now started at St George’s Primary School in Sheerness, Kent. The only noticeable difference between four-year-old Owen and the other children in the playground is his oversized uniform - the smallest available - as he is still catching up with his growth. Ms Piper, 29, from Minster, Kent, said: ‘Owen is so excited about school - every day he asked me “is it school yet mummy?” ‘He’s such an inspiration to me - I look at him every day and think he’s gone through so much already, but he’s just not fazed by anything. ‘It was the deepest, darkest time of my life when Owen was in hospital. ‘The only way to describe what we went through is that it was like being on a rollercoaster. Owen (pictured shortly after his birth) spent 17 weeks in intensive care after his birth in July 2009. He was eventually discharged on November 2 - the day after his due date . Owen has now started at St George's Primary School in Sheerness, Kent. He is still smaller than his peers and has lung disease but he is expected to fully recover by the time he is seven . ‘One day Owen would be doing really well and the next he would be at death’s door. ‘He’s come on leaps and bounds and he’s a proper little character. His talking is just phenomenal - he’s a real chatterbox. ‘I never in a million years thought he would go to a mainstream school, I always thought he’d be behind in something.’ Owen was born at Medway Maritime Hospital on July 10, 2009, and finally allowed home on November 2, the day after his due date. When Owen was born he was so small that his head was only as big as an egg. His first woolly hat is pictured on an egg cup . Owen's mother, Hayley Piper, said: 'He's such an inspiration to me - I look at him every day and think he's gone through so much.' Image shows a normal newborn nappy next to one of the ones used when Owen was born . He remained on oxygen for six months and still suffers from chronic lung disease, but doctors say that this problem should clear up by the time he is seven. The toddler has now been officially signed off by Medway Maritime Hospital and last winter was the first he did not have to be admitted to hospital after becoming unwell.

"Real estate heir Robert Durst (pictured during a court appearance in August) was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder . Robert Durst's mumblings about how he 'killed them all' provided the dramatic kick to a documentary about the millionaire's troubled life and connection to three slayings, but it was words he penned that helped lead to his arrest on a murder charge, a law enforcement official said. Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to his friend Susan Berman a year before her death with one he said 'only the killer could have written' to point police to her body was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation, a police source said. Durst, 71, was charged on Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Berman, the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster, back in 2000. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime. He waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him late on Monday with being a felon in possession of a gun because he had a revolver when he was arrested there Saturday. He was also found in possession of a small amount of marijuana. Prosecutors believed that Durst was a flight risk after the revelations of the documentary and may have been planning to head for Cuba. He was found with fake IDs in his hotel room. However one of his lawyers, Chip Lewis, told The LA Times that his client had left his Houston home for New Orleans to escape the media and that he had called daily to check in with him, asking for him by name. It was not clear how soon Durst would be returned to California. Attorney Dick DeGuerin said outside court that Durst didn't kill Berman, and is 'ready to end all the rumor and speculation and have a trial'. Presented with the two letters in the finale of The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst that aired Sunday on HBO, the eccentric heir blinked, burped oddly, pulled his ear and briefly put his head in his hands before denying he was the killer. Then he stepped away from the tense interview and went to the bathroom, still wearing the live microphone that recorded what he said next. 'There it is. You're caught!' Durst whispered before the sound of running water is heard. 'What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.' That moment didn't just make for a captivating ending to the documentary on the eccentric life of an heir to a New York real estate fortune, it could also provide additional evidence for prosecutors. The official said the bathroom recording was not presented to prosecutors before charges were filed because detectives were still trying to determine if the recording was tampered with in any way. But legal experts said the audio and other parts of the interview could become key evidence. Durst and documentary producer Andrew Jarecki (right) examine handwriting examples  from two letters. Analysis linking a letter Durst wrote to Susan Berman a year before her death with one he said 'only the killer could have written' to point police to her body was new evidence in the investigation, a police source said . Robert Durst, far right, was escorted into Orleans Parish Criminal District Court through a tunnel entrance, in New Orleans on Monday for a court hearing to extradite him to Los Angeles to face a murder charge . 'Any statement that the defendant makes that they want to use against him, they can use against him,' said Andrea Roth, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. 'Even if it's sketchy, and only in context appears to make him look guilty.' Kerry Lawrence, a defense attorney in Westchester County, New York, said Durst's lawyers will have to try to explain away his comments, perhaps dismissing them as a joke. 'Prosecutors would argue it was a candid moment of self-reflection, and I assume will argue that he knew he was still being recorded, and this was either said in jest or he was being facetious or sarcastic or was being provocative,' Lawrence said. 'I don't think it's quite the smoking gun.' Durst — still worth millions despite his estrangement from his family, whose New York real estate empire is worth about $4 billion — has maintained his innocence in three killings in as many states. When Durst approached the filmmakers and agreed to go on camera, against the advice of his lawyers, he had already weathered one murder case, winning an acquittal in a gory Galveston, Texas, dismemberment case by claiming he shot his neighbor in self-defense. He was still suspected in the killing of Berman, whose father was a Las Vegas mobster associated with Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky, and the disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, who was declared dead long after she vanished in New York in 1982. Susan Berman was found shot execution-style outside her home in LA in 2000. Her friend, Robert Durst, was charged with her murder on Monday . Kathleen's brother, Jim McCormack, told Today on Tuesday that he believed Durst's confession was genuine and an admission that the 71-year-old had killed his sister decades before. Mr McCormack said: 'The revelation was like something we‘ve been waiting for 33 years.' He added: 'I believe that Bob will somehow have an epiphany of conscience, contrary to the advice of lawyers. 'I think he’s about ready to say, ''You know, enough is enough. This is what Kathy would want and this is what I’m going to do.''' Susan Berman, 55, was shot once in the back of the head at her home near Beverly Hills shortly before New York investigators planned to question her about Kathleen Durst's disappearance. The documentary showed filmmaker Andrew Jarecki confronting Durst with a copy of an anonymous letter that alerted Beverly Hills police to look for a 'cadaver' at Berman's address. Durst offered that whoever sent it was 'taking a big risk. You're sending a letter to police that only the killer could have written.' Then, in the final episode, Jarecki revealed another envelope, which Durst acknowledged mailing to Berman, that has similar writing in block letters and also misspelled the address as 'Beverley.' 'I wrote this one but I did not write the cadaver one,' Durst said. But when shown an enlargement of both copies, Durst couldn't distinguish them. New York defense lawyer Michael Devorkin said the surprising thing was that police never unearthed the letter to Berman that filmmakers got their hands on. 'Even if Durst wasn't the prime suspect, you would think they would have been looking through all her papers to see if the person who killed her had ever written her a letter,' Devorkin said. 'Finding the letter was pure good fortune.' With the bathroom recording immediately following the confrontation over the two handwriting samples, prosecutors have strong evidence, said Devorkin, who handles white-collar criminal cases. 'How often do you have a Perry Mason moment to end your documentary?' he said. Robert Durst's first wife, Kathleen McCormack (pictured left),  has been missing since 1982.

'You know, I'm not going to be here and try to sum up what this place has meant to be mover the years. I couldn't' do that. We got plenty of time.' Getting emotional he then said; 'What is this fluid? What are these feelings? Frankenstein angry!' He closed by saying; 'It's been an absolute privilege. It's been the honor of my professional life, and I thank you for watching it. For hate watching it. Whatever reason you were tuning in for.' 'For the better part of the last two decades, I have had the incredible honor and privilege of working with Jon Stewart. His comedic brilliance is second to none,' Michele Ganeless, President of Comedy Central, said in a statement. 'Jon has been at the heart of Comedy Central, championing and nurturing the best talent in the industry, in front of and behind the camera. Through his unique voice and vision, ‘The Daily Show’ has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.' 'Jon will remain at the helm of The Daily Show’ until later this year,' she added. 'He is a comic genius, generous with his time and talent, and will always be a part of the Comedy Central family.' Steve Carell (left) and Olivia Munn (right) are just two of the A-list names who worked on The Daily Show . Stephen Colbert (above) left the show to host his own program on Comedy Central, The Colbert Report . Under Stewart, the show has won 18 Emmys, taking home the award for Best Variety Series every year from 2003 to 2012. It also won two Peabody Awards, for its election coverage in 2000 and 2004. The show has had two shows spin-off the program, The Colbert Report with Stephen Colbert and the recently debuted The Nightly Show with Larry Willmore. Another former corespondent, John Oliver, also hosts a similar news program on HBO, Last Week Tonight, which premiered last year. The show has also been the launching pad for many now A-list stars, including Ed Helms, Josh Gad, Olivia Munn, Rob Riggle, Rob Corddry and Steve Carell, who went on to star in The Office and was just nominated for an Oscar for his role in Foxcatcher. Stewart, 52, had hinted at his possible departure from this show starting late last year in interviews while promoting his directorial debut Rosewater. 'When do you decide that even though it's this place of great comfort and you feel like you're plugged into it like you've never been plugged into anything else that you've ever done, you know ... there are other considerations of family or even in the sense of just not wanting to be on television all the time' he told Terry Gross in an NPR interview. 'You know, you can't just stay in the same place because it feels like you've built a nice house there. And that's really the thing that I struggle with. And it is unclear to me.' He also tole The Hollywood Reporter when asked if he still enjoyed doing the show; 'Uh, yeah. I mean, like anything else, you do it long enough, you will take it for granted, or there will be aspects of it that are grinding. I can't say that following the news cycle as closely as we do and trying to convert that into something either joyful or important to us doesn't have its fraught moments. But there will come a point where I'm sure.' Stewart released his directorial debut Rosewater last year, and is seen with lead actor Gael Garcia Bernal . This as his contract, with a reported salary in the $25million to $35million range per year, is set to expire. There had also been talk of Stewart leaving when it was reported he was offered the hosting job on NBC's Meet the Press, something Stewart confirmed but a position he said he would never take. No doubt making this loss even more difficult for Comedy Central is that it comes on the heels of Colbert leaving his program to take over for the departing David Letterman on CBS's The Late Show. Almost immediately after the announcement was made, celebrities took to Twitter to pay tribute to Stewart's work on the show and state how upset they were to see him leaving. 'I KNEW WHEN JOHN STEWART LEFT TO DIRECT THAT MOVIE HE WAS GONNA TRY SOMETHING LIKE THIS,' joked Mindy Kaling. Former correspondent Gad wrote; 'Shocked & sad to see the man who gave me my big break on @TheDailyShow is ready to hang it up. #JonStewart can't wait to see what's next!' Piers Morgan also weighed in; 'Jon Stewart quitting? Good timing. He was beginning to be eclipsed by John Oliver. This way, he can leave on a high.' Craig Ferguson, who recently left his late night program, said; 'Congratulations to Jon Stewart on an extraordinary groundbreaking run.' Transparent actor and Togetherness creator Jay Duplass wrote; 'what will we do without you, Jon Stewart, oh captain our captain?' 'Washington is rigged for the big guys - and no person has more consistently called them out for it than Jon Stewart. Good luck, Jon!' said Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Samantha Bee and Jason Jones (above) have already been rumored as possible replacements for Stewart . Jon Stewart and his wife Tracey have a son and a daughter (above) Stewart made his debut on the show January 11, 1999, taking over for original host Craig Kilborn. Prior to that he had hosted the critically praised but little seen The Jon Stewart Show on MTV and appeared in films including Playing by Heart, Big Daddy, Wishful Thinking and The Faculty. He also twice served as host of both the Grammys and the Oscars while working on The Daily Show. Stewart released two books while at The Daily Show, co-written with his correspondents and the show's writers, America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction and Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race. His audio recording of America won him a Grammy. Stewart married his wife Tracey in 2000, and the couple have a son and a daughter. Already there have been rumors about who might replace Stewart, with current correspondents and husband and wife Jason Jones and Samantha Bee being the most popular choice."

Gary Clifford, 29, was left with a broken arm, two broken legs, a fractured foot and hundreds of cuts and bruises after his father and uncle tortured him - believing he had stolen jewellery from his step-mother. Leicester Crown Court heard how Gary’s father, Kevin Clifford, 51, uncle, Patrick Clifford, and a third man, John Cope, 47, had beaten Gary within an inch of his life and dumped him outside a pub. Sentencing Kevin to 16 years behind bars for GBH and false imprisonment, Judge Ebraham Mooncey called him an 'evil man' and said he couldn’t understand how a father could inflict such horrendous injuries on his own son. The court heard that Kevin Clifford lured his son to a workshop at the back of his home, with the offer of work, to carry out the barbaric punishment. During the attack his son was welded into the cage, had brake fluid sprayed into his face and was threatened with being set on fire. Prosecutor James Thomas said the assault was 'horrendous, amounting to torture'. The victim was subjected to the horrific and prolonged attack after he was suspected of stealing gold jewellery from his stepmother, Kevin Clifford’s wife, in April last year. The court was told father Kevin knew Cope was looking for Gary following a fall-out and recruited him, and his own brother, Patrick, 44, to help with the horrendous attack. Barbaric: The tiny cage in which Gary Clifford was welded into by his dad after he was beaten within an inch of his life . Gary of Derbyshire suffered multiple broken bones and lash marks having been relentlessly beaten with a baseball bat, a pipe and an industrial hose. Cope has turned up after Gary was welded into the cage and a jury heard that when he was taken out, Cope laughed as he smashed Gary’s kneecaps into several pieces. He too was handed 16 years in jail for false imprisonment and GBH. Jailed: John Cope was recruited by Kevin Clifford to join in the horrific attack because he had fallen out with him in the past. He too was jailed for 16 years . Mr Clifford was also battered in the face by his hammer-wielding uncle, who was jailed for 12 years after he admitting false imprisonment and inflicting grievous bodily harm. Judge Ebraham Mooncey said: 'Experienced ambulance officers said the injuries were the most extreme they’d ever seen. 'You don’t often hear of someone being hung upside down from a forklift truck and caged. He had a sack put over his head and a cable around his neck. 'Patrick and Kevin Clifford gave him a beating as he hung upside down and he received many injuries, from the waist to his head, at the hands of his father. 'It was a systematic beating of the most vile kind. 'The father of the victim stood calmly in court when he gave evidence, telling lie upon lie to the jury, saying he wasn’t involved in this enterprise.''It’s hard to fathom how a father, his own flesh and blood, could to something like this. 'I watched you giving evidence and I take the view you’re an evil man and you shouldn’t have done that to your son, whatever he’d done. 'The victim was subjected to gratuitous degradation.'Kevin Clifford and Cope had denied the charges, claiming they played no part in the violence but were both convicted after trial . Detective Chief Inspector Neil Castle said: 'This could easily have been a murder investigation. This young man has been through a horrendous ordeal and I hope today’s verdict goes some way to bringing closure on this chapter of his life.'Speaking after the trial Gary Clifford said: 'This incident has changed my life. It was absolutely horrendous and at the time I was wishing I could die. The pain was so unreal. 'But since then I have managed to move forward and I now want to put it behind me.'"
"An illegal immigrant who committed 'revolting' sex offences on the London Underground could receive a £7,000 payout because he was kept in jail for 'too long' while officials tried to deport him. Naseer Chawki, who claims to be 34 and from Iran, was detained for more than four years while Home Office officials fought for deportation, after he was convicted of sexually abusing two women on a rush-hour Piccadilly Line train. But he has now won a High Court battle against Home Secretary Theresa May, after a judge ruled that he had been illegally held for seven months - against his human rights - during that process. Naseer Chawki, who sexually assaulted two women on a rush-hour Tube, could be awarded £7,000 after the High Court (pictured) ruled he was unlawfully held for ten months while officials tried to deport him . Deputy High Court Judge Stephen Morris said Chawki's payout is yet to be assessed, giving no indication of what the figure would be. But according to human rights lawyers, the payout given to Chawki could be between £5,000 and £10,000. In 2013, a Supreme Court judgment set a precedent that those detained illegally should receive around £1,000 for each month they are held against their human rights. It means Chawki can expect to receive around £7,000. During today's hearing in London, the court heard how Chawki - who has failed in a bid to claim asylum - arrived in Cardiff from Iran in 1999 before moving to Liverpool. He then moved to Seven Sisters, north London. The court heard how, in November 2008, Chawki was given a three-year jail term for carrying out two sex assaults on the London Underground, as well as possessing a false identity document. Home Secretary Theresa May (pictured) had claimed Chawki was held because he posed a 'serious risk' to the public but has lost the case . Chawki had pleaded guilty to the offences, after he pressed himself against the women on a crowded rush-hour train. The attacks had been witnessed by commuters and Chawki was later traced using DNA evidence and Oyster card records. During the hearing over those offences, the court heard how the  'revolting' sex attacks had had 'very lasting effects' on the victims. Judge Martin Beddoe, who heard the case at Southwark Crown Court, said he would recommend deportation after he had served time in jail for the crimes. Chawki was then released from jail in December 2009. Following an order for his deportation, he was placed in immigration detention, while officials began the process. But he was released from immigration detention in March last year after attempts to deport him failed. He was made to wear a monitoring tag. After his release, Chawki launched a legal battle, claiming he had been held in immigration detention when then was 'no prospect' of him being deported. Mrs May disputed his claim, saying he posed a 'serious risk of harm' and that there was a 'serious risk' that he would abscond. Judge Morris ruled that detention had been lawful for the majority of the four years and four months Chawki was held. But he ruled that the detention had been unlawful between mid-September 2013 and March last year. He said that, by that time, there had been 'no sufficient prospect of removal within a reasonable time'. During the 2013 case which set the precedent on the issue of payouts, the Court of Appeal held that the Secretary of State had breached the human rights of Mr Faulkner by keeping him in detention for 10 months longer than necessary. Mr Faulkner was serving a life sentence but had brought the case over the delay in reviewing the need for his further detention, on the grounds of whether it was necessary for public protection. The Secretary of State was ordered to pay him £10,000 in damages, setting a precedent of around £1,000 in damages per month held unlawfully."
"Hong Kong is in the midst of a passionate debate about our constitutional development. It's a debate we must have. But it's a debate that must be tempered with reason. Raw emotion -- for or against the proposed political reform -- will get us nowhere. It must also be a discussion based on the constitutional framework that provides for a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) within China. Much discussion has centered around the recent decision of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) of China on the parameters for electing the chief executive (CE) by one-person, one-vote in 2017. Critics say the nominating framework is too restrictive and that only candidates favored by Beijing will eventually appear on the ballot. Such claims are unfounded as we have not even started to discuss the detailed but crucial aspects of the nominating process for potential chief executive candidates. This will be the subject of a public consultation to be launched soon and which will eventually lead to the enabling legislation on changes to the electoral method for the 2017 election. Election method . On the question of electing the chief executive, the Basic Law, Hong Kong's ""mini-constitution,"" provides that ""the ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures."" To change over to this new election method, the Basic Law requires the endorsement of a two-thirds majority of all (currently 70) members of the Legislative Council, the consent of the CE, and be reported to the NPCSC of China for approval. Basically, we have two choices: retain the current system by which the CE is elected by a 1,200-person election committee; or, adopt an enhanced system, the one recently announced by the NPCSC, that will see two to three candidates in a full-fledged election at which Hong Kong's five million eligible voters will exercise this right for the first time. Historic step . I sincerely hope that legislators will take the historic step forward to achieve universal suffrage for the election in 2017 as scheduled. So far the debate has focused on the system per se. But the chief executive's unique constitutional position within China also needs to be understood more clearly in order to fully appreciate the basis for the electoral process. Unlike other cities or provinces in China, or for that matter, those in other countries, the HKSAR enjoys a far higher degree of autonomy in many areas including our legal system, legislature, internal security, immigration, customs, economy, finances, trade, industry, commerce, shipping, aviation, education, sport, religion and external affairs. All these are enshrined in our Basic Law. These additional powers are devolved from the Central People's Government. This is why the central government has the power to appoint the chief executive as well as principal officials. This is also why the central government has a constitutional role in approving any changes to the electoral method for the chief executive. Hong Kong is society with a deep respect for the rule of law. It is the pillar of our success. Our common law system and an independent judiciary are protected by the Basic Law which I, as the chief executive, have pledged to uphold and protect. It is my fundamental and constitutional duty to work towards the goal of electing the chief executive by universal suffrage within that legal framework."
"By . Damien Gayle . PUBLISHED: . 03:32 EST, 12 October 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 03:32 EST, 12 October 2012 . Femme fatale: Kim Basinger as Lynn Bracken in LA Confidential. A study has shown attractive women are more likely to be seen as guilty of murder . Women charged with murder who plead self defence are more likely to be perceived as guilty if have 'thick lips' and 'smooth and harmonious facial features', says a study. The findings made by a team from the University of Grenada, Spain, contradict the generally held stereotype that beauty deflects criminal responsibility. They found that in the case of a woman claiming self defence in the killing of an abusive husband, police officers were more likely to regard as innocent defendants who were described as unattractive. The findings also showed that women perceived as more independent and in charge of their lives were also more likely to be seen as guilty of murder. Legal processes are ideally conducted without bias, but in reality biases influence all human judgements and looking at how these prejudices shape behaviour should help to minimise their effect. In the past, social psychology has widely accepted the contention that beautiful people are less likely to be regarded as criminally responsible. As the study's authors put it: 'Attractive people are often perceived as having positive personality features and attributes in consonance with the implicit theory that ""beauty is goodness"".' This 'halo effect' has also been previously shown to influence perception of other traits, with attractive people seen as 'more sociable, friendly, warm, competent and intelligent than unattractive individuals.' To test this effect in the scenario of domestic violence, the Grenada team created fictitious scenarios in which a woman was accused of stabbing her husband to death as he lay in bed. In each case, the woman's story was that she had been the victim of years of domestic violence and had finally killed her husband out of self defence. The only difference between narratives was the defendant's description. In one story she was described with features typically regarded as beautiful: 'María is an attractive woman with thick lips; smooth, harmonious facial features; straight blonde hair; and a slender and elegant appearance.' In the other story she was described as 'unattractive': 'María is an unattractive woman with thin lips, stern and jarring facial features, dark bundled hair, and is neither slender nor elegant in appearance.' The other variable, which the researchers evaluated separately from the defendant's physical attractiveness, was her likeness to the 'prototype of a battered woman'. In some of the stories: 'María is a 36-year old housewife with two children (six and three years old) who has been married for 10 years. María wears sunglasses that hide her face, has poor personal appearance and dress, and is timid in answering the judge or lawyers' questions.' While in the others: 'María is a financial consultant of a leading company; she has no children, and has been married for ten years. María is a well-dressed fashion-conscious woman, calm and resolute in her interactions with the judge and lawyers.' The researchers then showed 169 police officers from the Spanish national and local police forces one of the stories each and had them give their personal judgement on the defendant's guilt. The original femme fatale: Barbara Stanwyck with Fred MacMurray in the 1944 noir classic Double Indemnity, in which she plays a woman who convinces an insurance investigator to help her murder her husband . The results were surprising. Contrary . to the hypothesis that the attractive defendant would 'receive a more . benevolent appraisal of criminality' it was found that the 'unattractive women defendants were attributed less criminal responsibility.' Women are twice as likely as men to use emoticons in text messages, according to a new study from Rice University. The symbols, which began as happy and sad smiling faces but have since morphed into dozens of expressions, have become hugely popular in text messages and email. The new study used smartphone data from men and women over six months and analysed 124,000 text messages. The participants were given free iPhones to use for the test period but didn’t know what researchers were investigating. The team says the study was unique. 'We believe that our study represents the first naturalistic and longitudinal study that collects real emoticon use from text messages ""in the wild"",' said Philip Kortum, assistant professor of psychology at Rice and one of the study’s authors. The researchers were less surprised to find, however, that the defendant who did not fit the stereotype of a battered woman was more likely to be regarded as guilty. She was perceived as having 'more control over the situation, which in legal terms can translate as a higher degree of guilt', the researchers said. The study's authors say their research has important implications for the way police officers are trained to deal with domestic violence. 'These findings and interpretation have been systematically reported in the literature i.e., people who behave atypically and violate the expectations of others are perceived as having greater intentionality as their behaviour is judged be the result of their own free will,' 'These findings and interpretation have been systematically reported in the literature i.e., people who behave atypically and violate the expectations of others are perceived as having greater intentionality as their . behaviour is judged be the result of their own free will.' The findings were published in the European Journal of Psychology Applied to Legal Context."
"One of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history will be replayed in a Colorado courtroom — but only after an unprecedented jury pool of 9,000 people is winnowed to a handful to decide whether James Holmes was insane when he opened fire in a suburban movie theater. Holmes is one of the few suspects to survive such an attack — many are killed by police or commit suicide. His survival has sparked an emotionally charged debate in which his parents have begged for a plea deal that would save his life, while many survivors and family members of victims have demanded that he stand trial and face the death penalty if convicted. Jury selection begins Tuesday, and the trial could run until October. It could provide a look into the mind of Holmes, whose attorneys acknowledge was the gunman in the July 20, 2012, attack but say he was in the grip of a psychotic episode at the time. Inside Courtroom 201: Here, jury selection in the trial of Aurora movie theater shootings defendant James Holmes is to begin Tuesday at the Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colorado . 'The public is going to get an insight into the mind of a killer who says he doesn't know right from wrong,' said Alan Tuerkheimer, a Chicago-based jury consultant. 'It is really rare. It just doesn't usually come to this.' Holmes, 27, was arrested as he stripped off his combat gear in the parking lot of the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora, where 12 people were killed and 70 injured during a midnight showing of a new Batman movie. He later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder. If jurors find him guilty, they must then decide whether to recommend the death penalty. If Holmes is found not guilty, he would be committed indefinitely to the state mental hospital. Under Colorado law, defendants are not legally liable for their acts if their minds are so 'diseased' that they cannot distinguish right from wrong. Part of the reason the case has dragged on so long is the battle over whether that standard applies to Holmes. Few details on those arguments have been made public. Prosecutors and defense attorneys remain under a long-running gag order, and court documents detailing the issue have stayed under seal. HOW THE JURY WILL BE CHOSEN: Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. called an unusually large number of people for jury duty, citing the difficulty in finding an unbiased panel. Samour expects it to take until May or June before he can find 12 jurors and 12 alternates. Prosecutors will try to ensure jurors have no reservations about the death penalty while defense attorneys will look for those sympathetic to mental illness and uneasy with the idea of executing a person. On trial: James Holmes is accused of shooting dead 12 moviegoers and injuring 70 others in July 2012 . WHAT JURY LIFE WILL BE LIKE: Jurors won't be sequestered — isolated in a hotel — but will be allowed to go home every night. Samour will tell them they may not discuss the case with anyone, do any independent research on it, or watch, read or listen to news reports about it. Their names won't be made public, and Samour has forbidden news organizations from taking their photos. THREE PHASES IN JURY SELECTION . Source: The Denver Channel . Selection begins: As 9,000 prospective jurors are whittled down to just 24, the men and women will be warned starting Tuesday of the graphic police photos and other evidence they might be subjected to over the course of the trial . Holmes' sanity was evaluated by a state psychiatrist but the results were not made public. Prosecutors objected to the findings and persuaded a judge to order a second evaluation. Those results were contested by the defense. Prosecutors previously rejected at least one proposed plea deal made by attorneys for Holmes, criticizing the lawyers for publicizing the offer and calling it a ploy to draw the public and judge into what should be private plea negotiations. Survivors of the attack and family members of victims have had a long time to get ready for a trial. 'We've all been to therapists and have talked to our families and have our support groups, so we're prepared,' said Marcus Weaver, who was shot in the arm and whose friend, Rebecca Wingo, died in the attack. 'It's gonna be quite the journey.' It could take until June to find 12 jurors and 12 alternates who were not biased by widespread news coverage of the shooting. Insane? Jurors will have to decide both whether Holmes is guilty and if he's sane enough to answer for the crimes . Century 16 cinema in Aurora, Colorado . Jurors will see the majority of the gruesome photographs and video taken at the crime scene, but a handful of images will be barred, the judge overseeing the case ruled on Tuesday. Defense lawyers had argued the photos could prejudice the jury against Holmes, who has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity. But prosecutors countered that they were necessary to make their case against the California native, and Arapahoe County District Court Judge Carlos Samour rejected most of the defense's motion in his ruling, saying images which depict the aftermath of crimes charges are allowed. 'That many of the photographs will be difficult to view does not render them inadmissible,' Samour wrote, adding that the same logic applied to the disturbing video footage recorded inside the cinema following the rampage. Prosecutors have charged Holmes with multiple counts of first-degree murder and attempted murder, and have said they will seek the death penalty for the one-time neuroscience doctoral candidate if he is convicted. The judge said he was 'disinclined' to allow into evidence one photo showing a disemboweled woman, if the prosecution could provide a less graphic version. Images of a bloody emergency room where victims were treated are likewise inadmissible, Samour ruled, because their value is 'substantially outweighed by the danger for unfair prejudice.' Victims: Six-year-old Veronica Moser, left, and 18-year-old AJ Boik, right, a popular musician and art student, were among the 12 people who lost their lives in the shooting last July . Photos and video taken inside Holmes' car that show a skull-shaped gearshift, and which the defense wanted barred, will be allowed because they depict part of the crime scene, he said, but prosecutors cannot tell the jury the defendant's choice of gearshift reflects any criminal intent. Samour did agree with defense lawyers who asked that a photo showing an undisclosed poster on the refrigerator in Holmes' apartment be cropped or blurred, saying the poster could offend some jurors. Jury summonses were sent to 9,000 county residents this month, and jury selection is set to begin in January. Samour has told lawyers from both sides to prepare to make their opening statements in late May or early June. Last week, Holmes' parents broke their silence over the killings, saying their son is mentally ill, 'not a monster,' and should be spared the death penalty. Scene: Crosses, flowers and other mementos of the victims of the Aurora movie theater shooting are shown  with the movie theater in the background . Ready to fight: Arapahoe County, Colorado District Attorney George Brauchler, left, walks with an unidentified man out of courtroom after a pre-trial readiness hearing . Equally challenging will be finding jurors who were not personally affected by the attack that sent waves of grief and anger through the Arapahoe County suburbs of Denver. Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. called nearly nine times as many prospective jurors as were summoned in the ongoing Boston marathon bombing trial. That meant the county's 600,000 residents had a nearly one-in-50 chance of being selected. Among those summoned were at least 13 people who were either witnesses to the attack or have family members who work in the prosecutor's office. They were quickly excused. Starting Tuesday, prospective jurors will report in groups of about 250 to fill out a long questionnaire that hasn't been made public. Those who aren't excluded because of their answers will be called back for individual questioning. Potential jurors won't be allowed to read or talk about the case until they know they've been dismissed. That will be difficult in the era of social media, since they have no control over what pops up on their Facebook or Twitter feeds. The final panel won't be sequestered. During the selection process, Holmes' attorneys will focus on picking jurors who are morally opposed to capital punishment, even as prosecutors fight to ensure those on the panel are 'death-penalty eligible,' meaning they would be open to executing Holmes. 'It is really stacked against the defense,' said Joseph Rice, managing partner of the Jury Research Institute, a California-based trial consulting firm. 'Here, you have a horrific crime occurring in a public setting where you think people would be safe. ... Because of the heinous nature of the crime and the number of victims, I can see people who would say, 'In most instances I could not support the death penalty, and in this case, I can.'' Enduring the trial from the jury box would seem more difficult than the selection process. 'This is going to be a life-changing event for every juror who sits on the trial,' Rice said. 'They are going to deal with life-and-death issues that will forever be part of their experience.' Members of the the prosecution team from the Arapahoe County District Attorney's office leave the Century 16 theater after spending more than an hour there in 2012 ."
"The head of the IMF has refused to ‘go on my knees’ to apologise to George Osborne for wrongly warning his austerity cuts would harm the British economy. Christine Lagarde admitted ‘we got it wrong’ after the global financial watchdog warned the UK Chancellor he was ‘playing with fire’ by pressing ahead despite a sluggish recovery. Pressed repeatedly on whether she had apologised to Mr Osborne in person, Miss Lagarde admitted mistakes in growth forecasts but hit back: ‘Do I have to go on my knees and bend over backwards to say it?’ IMF chief Christine Lagarde has admitted getting it wrong on British growth, after urging Chancellor George Osborne to change course on the cuts . Last year, the International Monetary Fund caused a huge row when it claimed Government cuts were harming the prospects for the economy. It warned Britain was ‘still a long way from a strong and sustainable recovery’. Olivier Blanchard, chief economist at the IMF, said Mr Osborne was 'playing with fire' by pressing ahead with austerity before the recovery gathers pace. He added: 'In the face of weak demand it is really time to reconsider an adjustment to the fiscal consolidation plans.' But over the past year the economy has recovered and the IMF has since upgraded forecasts four times in a row. The IMF now expects growth of 2.9 per cent rate of growth in 2014, putting Britain on course to grow faster than any of the G7 richest countries, including the US, Germany and France. Appearing on BBC One’s Andrew Marr show, Miss Lagarde was pressed repeatedly on whether she had apologised to Mr Osborne for the IMF’s strident warnings which turned out to be wrong. ‘We said very clearly that we had underestimated growth for the UK and that we had, our forecasts, had been proven wrong by the reality of economic developments and I’m happy to repeat it for you.’ In April the International Monetary Fund was forced to admit the UK economy was on course to grow by 2.9 per cent this year, faster than any other G7 country . Miss Largarde admitted that Mr Osborne had faced intense pressure to change course after the IMF criticism, ‘but he resisted, as he would’. Asked several times if she had said sorry, she hit back: ‘I completely acknowledge that we underestimated growth. Now, do I have to go on my knees and bend over backwards to say it? ‘We got it wrong. We acknowledged it. We were not the only ones to get it wrong, we were in good company actually. ‘Most forecasters got it wrong, and clearly the confidence building that has resulted from the economic policies adopted by the government has surprised many of us.’ After being in the economic doldrums for many months, the UK economy is growing faster than most major economies – and crucially is not relying on consumer spending to fuel the boom. ‘It is growth is fuelled both by consumption but also now investment, but not just public investment as we recommended earlier on, but also with private investment,’ Miss Lagarde added. ‘Exports is lagging behind a little bit, but those two big cylinders of growth, consumption and investment, are fuelling growth, which in our view makes it more sustainable than if it was fuelled exclusively by consumption as was feared a few months back.’ She warned risks remained on low productivity and rising housing prices, but asked if there was a property boom in Britain, Miss Lagarde replied: ‘No. What our team has clearly seen and acknowledged is that the housing market in the UK is multi-faceted.’"
"Losing your keys is bad enough, but having to replace the entire lock because you don’t have a key to copy makes things even worse - not to mention expensive. The KeyMe app promises to take the hassle and cost out of this by letting you store photos of your keys online, and order duplicates in the post. Alternatively, the US service has kiosks that let you copy keys in an emergency, or share photos with a locksmith in person. KeyMe is a New York-based digital locksmith. The app lets homeowners scan (pictured left) and store their keys in the cloud (pictured right), share these scans with family and friends, and order duplicates in the post. KeyMe is free on iOS but is only currently available in the US . KeyMe is free on iOS but is currently only available in the US. The New York-based startup is looking to expand the service, and an Android version of the app is in development. After setting up an account, homeowners use their smartphone camera to take a photo of each side of the key. The photo must be taken on a white background, from a distance of up to 4 inches (10cm), in order to avoid what the app calls ‘fly-by’ scans. After setting up an account,  homeowners use their smartphone camera to take a photo of each side of the key. The photo has to be taken on a white background, from to 4 inches (10cm) away, in order to avoid what the app calls ‘fly-by’ scans. Once a key is successfully scanned and stored, users can send their digital keychain to friends, family and housemates over email. The owner and recipient can then order duplicates from within the app. Storing keys is free, but the cost of ordering duplicates depends on the type of key being copied, with prices starting at $10 (£6). Alternatively, photos can be used by physical locksmiths to create copies, or users can print keys from KeyMe kiosks. This doesn’t, in theory, protect people from criminals taking photos of other people's keys though. However, KeyMe does notify users whenever there is activity on their account, but this only applies if a potential thief is using that person’s account. It is unknown whether KeyMe can recognise if the same key is scanned and added to a different account. As an extra security measure, however, the app requires user verification, a credit card, a verified mailing address and an Apple-verified device and ID to purchase a key. Michael Harbolt, vice president of marketing at KeyMe told MailOnline that if a thief, hypothetically, did want to steal a key and order a new one using the app, they 'would then have to use an Apple registered device, Apple ID and wireless carrier to download the app and provide user verification to access the app. '[They] would then have to provide a valid credit card to purchase these keys and a  mailing address. All of the data provided during this exchange could be used to easily identify [them].' As an alternative, Mr Harbolt explained that a thief could 'simply walk down to a local locksmith and get a copy made by paying cash' without providing any method of identification. 'Given a choice of the these two options - one where you can easily be identified, and one where there is no risk of being identified - as a criminal, which option are you more likely to pursue when attempting to commit a crime?,' continued Mr Harbolt. In terms of protecting the keys stored in the cloud, the company said: ‘We use commercial grade security to protect your key data. ‘Additionally, we do not store any personally identifiable information except for an email address and password.’ But, these security concerns only apply to ordering keys in the post. If a key is ordered from a locksmith in person, the user can verify their identity by having the phone, app and another form of physical ID.

"PUBLISHED: . 11:35 EST, 26 February 2014 . | . UPDATED: . 17:52 EST, 26 February 2014 . Republicans in Congress have been licking their chops for nine months at the prospect of grilling embattled former IRS official Lois Lerner a second time, but her lawyer says they still can't have their chance. Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has called Lerner back for a second hearing on March 5 about a program that saw the IRS targeting tea party organizations and other right-leaning groups with intrusive questions and years-long delays when they applied for nonprofit tax-exempt status beginning in 2009. But in a letter to Issa, her attorney says she shouldn't have to appear because she has received death threats. If she does show up, he adds, she still won't answer questions unless she has immunity from prosecution or an order from a federal judge. Lerner appeared in a committee hearing in May 2013 but refused to answer questions, invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But because she offered an opening statement in which she insisted 'I have not done anything wrong,' committee members ruled that she had waived that privilege. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

In a letter to Lerner’s lawyer on Tuesday, Issa set March 5 as the date she will have to answer probing questions about her role in the scandal – and possibly finger higher-ups who directed her to play political favorites and hamstring conservative applicants. But her lawyer, William W. Taylor III, replied hours later with a letter saying he had warned committee staffers that 'calling Ms. Lerner [as a witness] knowing that she will assert her rights was not only improper but dangerous.' 'Ms. Lerner has been the subject of numerous threats on her life and safety, and on the life and safety of her family,' he wrote. 'I left with the staff recent evidence of those threats.' He added that her tune might change if she was promised she couldn't face criminal charges. 'If granted immunity, she has no choice but to testify … the essence of an order conferring immunity is that it commands her to testify,' Taylor told The Washington Times. Lerner, who retired in September with full benefits after a brief period of administration leave, is 'is uniquely positioned to provide testimony that will help the committee better understand how and why the IRS targeted these groups,' Issa wrote. 'The subpoena you accepted on Ms. Lerner’s behalf remains in effect,' he told Taylor. 'In light of this fact, and because the committee explicitly rejected her Fifth Amendment privilege claim, I expect her to provide answers when the hearing reconvenes.' The House Committee on Oversight and Government Affairs has ruled that Lerner can't plead the Fifth Amendment like she did nine months ago, finding that she waived that privilege by giving a defensive opening statement . More than two dozen tea party groups have responded to what they say is unfair treatment by suing the federal government . Taylor didn't respond to a message seeking comment. The . IRS's practices became national news when Lerner casually dropped . information about targeting conservative groups into a . question-and-answer session during a Washington, D.C. meeting of tax . administrators in early May. Days . later, an internal audit of the agency was released, showing that some . tea party organizations' tax-exempt applications were held up for as . long as 30 months. Documents released by Issa's committee showed that . officials in Washington had a hand in taking over some cases from a . satellite office in Cincinnati, Ohio. More recently, an email surfaced showing that Lerner was among several officials who discussed a program in 2011 aimed at reviewing conservative groups' applications more closely in an 'off plan' strategy meant to be kept out of public view. House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa may have larger ambitions: He told New Hampshire activists on Feb. 17 to unite against Obama's 'imperial presidency' The Obama administration has taken . heat from conservatives who insist that the White House had a role in . the plan, which matured at the height of the 2010 election season when . tea party activists were at their most vocal and effective. Democrats . in Congress have responded that there is no evidence anyone meant to . step on conservatives' right to freely exercise political speech. Now the IRS has moved to codify the ad hoc rules that put right-wing groups in limbo, proposing a raft of new regulations to govern the future evaluation of applications for 501(c)(4) tax-exempt status. Its stated intention is to rein in overtly political activity by those applicants – including voter registration drives, candidate forums and other election-focused programs. Federal law prohibits groups receiving tax exemptions from electioneering. But Republicans say the IRS is playing favorites and stifling free speech, and they point to nearly 70,000 public comments submitted to the Treasury Department in opposition to the plan. A proposal in the House, expected to pass along party lines, would force a year-long moratorium before the IRS could formalize its proposed rules. But the measure faces almost certain defeat in the Democrat-controlled Senate. More than two dozen tea party groups have sued the federal government since last summer, with the American Center for Law and Justice representing most of them. 'The decision to recall Lois Lerner to testify before this House panel is not only appropriate but necessary to get to the bottom of this unlawful targeting scheme,' the group's lead counsel, Jay Sekulow, said Wednesday. 'The committee correctly concluded that Lerner waived her constitutional rights to refuse to answer questions before the panel. We know that she is deeply involved in this targeting scheme – even involved in planning new rules to restrict free speech ... It’s time for Lerner to stop the stonewalling – to present the facts and to tell the truth.'"
"Hot diggity dog! The former home of Oscar G. Mayer Sr., son of the man who established the Oscar Mayer Company, is now up for grabs. The $1.75 million Evanston, Illinois, home features six bedrooms and four bathrooms, plus 7,401 square feet, according to its listing. Many of the 1903 home's windows are boarded up - indeed, its listing says 'Elegance of a bygone era is still there, but much work needs to be done to restore to previous grandeur.

'Amazing original woodwork and stairway. Being sold in ""as is' condition."" The listing says Mayer occupied the residence for 18 years, from 1927 all the way to 1965. Mayer died in March of that year. His father Oscar F. Mayer established the Oscar Mayer Company, Crain's Business Chicago reported last month.  Oscar G. Mayer Sr. grew up to eventually serve as chairman. Former resident Sigmund Eisenschenk's estate is selling the home, according to the website. The estate special administrator Peter J. Schmeidel told Crain's that the home's sale was accepted by a judge in autumn 2014. Evanston History Center's Krist Hartzell told the website the home was built in 1901 and was a Hallburg & Sturm creation. She also told the website there is a curved tower inside the home as well as a ballroom. Hartzell said she didn't believe the home will be knocked down, since it is a local landmark. 'There's been a lot of buzz and concern for this house... everyone was concerned no one was taking care of it and that it was going to deteriorate beyond the point of repair,' she told Crain's Chicago Business. 'We're pleased that it's on the market.' The first of the company's famed Wienermobiles was created in 1936, and its 'Oh, I'd love to be an Oscar Mayer wiener. That is what I'd truly like to be' song first appeared in 1963, the company says. His son, Oscar G. Mayer Jr., later served as company chairman, retired in 1977, and died in 2009 according to the Associated Press. Former owner: Oscar G.

"A bio-drone that dissolves after use leaving no trace it ever existed may sound like the stuff of a James Bond film, but NASA and a team of researchers are actually building one. Made from a substance that combines mushroom fibers and cloned paper wasp spit, the drone might resemble a propeller-powered egg carton, but its designers say it has the ability to fly into environmentally sensitive areas and leave almost no trace. Lynn Rothschild, the NASA developer guiding students from Stanford-Brown-Spelman working on the project, says the drone could be made to disappear simply by ditching it into a stream or puddle. She said her interest in unmanned aerial vehicles was sparked by work on environmentally sensitive areas in her Earth Science group at NASA. ""Periodically, UAVs get lost -- for example on coral reefs or in other sensitive habitats,"" she said in an interview with the project team. ""As I started to hear about this, I thought, 'Well, wouldn't it be useful if the UAV was biodegradable, so if it crashed somewhere that was sensitive, it wouldn't matter if it dissolved."" The mushroom-like substance known as mycelium, which makes up the chassis of the drone, is being hailed as the new plastic -- a plastic that has the advantage of degrading quickly. The team grew cellulose ""leather""  to coat the fungal body of the flying craft and then covered the sheets with proteins sourced from the saliva of paper wasps -- a water resistant material that the insects use to cover their nests. The circuits are printed from silver nanoparticle ink in an effort to make the machine as biodegradable as possible. Despite a heavy preponderance of biological parts, the team said the project had its limits. ""There are definitely parts that can't be replaced by biology, "" said Stanford University's Raman Nelakanti. At its first short flight at the International Genetically Engineered Machine competition in Boston, the team used a standard battery, motor and propellers to fly the drone. Nevertheless, the team is working on making other parts biodegradable and is studying how to build its sensors from modified E. coli bacteria, the bacteria most commonly found in the intestines of humans and animals. The team said that ultimately the drone could be sent into areas where it might not be expected to return such as wildfires or nuclear accidents, sending data and never coming back. While the parts degrade naturally, the team also experimented with enzymes that would help the drone self-destruct, breaking it down further on impact. Creating a drone that does not infect the environment has been another challenge for the team. ""If you have living organisms acting as biosensors and the plane crashes, there certainly could be problems as the plane interacts with the environment,"" Rothschild said. ""Hopefully people could think of this in advance, and design such that this never becomes a problem. ""For example, on crashing, the cells might die. Or the cells could be attenuated. There are all sorts of other processes to keep them from contaminating the environment. But that, to me, is the largest concern with a biological UAV - having living things on the UAV.""

"Nine rookie police officers have lost their jobs because of a drunken graduation party in northern New Jersey. It all happened when members of the academy’s 113th graduating class gathered at Texas Arizona in Hoboken, New Jersey, to celebrate their big day. A source says that the officers 'were drunk and out of control, and identified themselves as police officers when resisting bar bouncers who tried to quiet them.' Venue: The Port Authority investigated after news reports emerged of an out-of-control party at the Texas Arizona Bar and Grill in Hoboken, New Jersey, (pictured) after the graduation ceremony in August . According to NJ.com, the bar then contacted the Hoboken Police Department, who in turn contact the Port Authority Police Department. Now, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey says it's re-examining the entire candidate selection and training process. In a statement, executive director Pat Foye calls it 'a sad day' for the department. Foye says he was disappointed by their conduct and appalled by the 'poor judgment' of the police academy's staff who attended. Damning: It has been reported that the Internal Affairs Bureau got hold of 'devastating' video evidence from inside the bar which lead to the officers' dismissal . Three other new officers are suspended without pay for 30 days and will have their probationary status extended for a year. Three supervisors and two other officers will face disciplinary proceedings. No names were released. Video footage, along with eyewitness reports, led to the dismissals. The site reported that the video was given to the Internal Affairs Bureau and was so clear they could see the badge numbers of those involved. Making an already bad situation even worse, was the fact that some of the officers were untruthful during the investigation into what happened. Symbol: A Port Authority Police Department banner is posted on a barbed wire fence outside Ground Zero and One World Trade Center. Many of the officers graduating would have been posted there . There were 210 men and 39 women at the graduation ceremony. Many of them will be posted at One World Trade Center and Ground Zero."
"Ahlem Gamri was always sipping bottled water in an effort to drink the recommended eight glasses a day . Like many women, Ahlem Gamri was always sipping bottled water in an effort to drink the recommended eight glasses a day. As a consultant in the oil and gas industry, who travels around the world, she kept a bottle in her handbag to drink on the move. ‘It’s common knowledge that drinking water is fundamental in maintaining health,’ she says. But despite her best efforts to stay healthy, she was baffled when she began to suffer from a range of symptoms. ‘I felt bloated and wiped out, no matter how much sleep I got,’ says Ahlem, 37, from London. ‘I tried cutting out bread and exercised more in a bid to boost my metabolism and snap me out of it, but I still felt terrible. I had odd symptoms that would flare up and subside without warning — muscle aches, joint pain, dizziness, palpitations, nausea.’ For three years, she consulted endocrinologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists and immunologists. Every expert offered different solutions to the symptoms — but none could explain what was actually wrong. ‘It wasn’t until I saw naturopathic doctor Nigma Talib that I got any answers,’ says Ahlem. ‘After a battery of tests, she identified I had a magnesium deficiency.’ Surprisingly, some think drinking bottled water may be a contributing factor. This little-heard-of deficiency is surprisingly common among women — one survey found one in ten suffers from it, but some experts cite figures as high as seven in ten — and the effects can be devastating. From maintaining energy levels to steadying heart rhythm, regulating blood pressure and keeping bones strong, magnesium is vital for the body. Scroll down for video . Symptoms of deficiency include agitation and anxiety, restless leg syndrome, sleep disorders, nausea and vomiting, abnormal heart rhythms, muscle spasm and weakness, hyperventilation, poor nail growth and even seizures. And, disastrously, modern diets are not just lacking in magnesium — they actively deplete it. The recommended daily intake for adults is 420mg for men and 320mg for women. Once this would have been easy to get from a mix of wholegrains, green leafy vegetables, nuts and meat. Magnesium is the second most abundant metal . in seawater — only salt is more abundant . But intensive farming has seen the magnesium content in vegetables decline by as much as 80 per cent since 1950. Caffeine, alcohol, processed grains and sugar prompt the kidneys to expel magnesium, depleting already low levels still further. Moreover, many of us have swapped a significant source of magnesium — tap water — for bottled water, which often has a far lower content. Modern lifestyles are also at fault. Stress can be a cause and a symptom of magnesium deficiency. The stress hormones adrenaline and cortisol, released in ‘fight or flight’ situations, deplete the body’s natural stores. But as magnesium helps to regulate blood pressure and heart rhythm, a deficiency may mean stress is tougher to handle. Dr Christy Ferguson uses magnesium to treat migraines as it has a relaxing and calming effect on the body . These low magnesium levels are difficult to diagnose. A blood test rarely helps as just 1 per cent of the body’s magnesium stores are found in blood. The rest is in our bones and muscles. Worse still, typical symptoms of magnesium deficiency — pain, fatigue, insomnia and muscle cramps — are common to many other conditions so doctors may wrongly diagnose anything from irritable bowel syndrome and pre-menstrual tension to migraine and fibromyalgia. In France, magnesium is offered to patients suffering from PMT, stress or fatigue. Nutritional therapist Dr Christy Ferguson says: ‘Magnesium hasn’t had much publicity — the food industry doesn’t use it to promote its products as it does with calcium. Magnesium deficiency is hard to diagnose, so many people don’t know they have it.’ Ahlem Gamri, 37, from London, consulted endocrinologists, neurologists, gastroenterologists, rheumatologists and immunologists about her fatigue . Ironically, calcium is useless without magnesium, which is why a deficiency is implicated in osteoporosis. So experts argue that many typical manifestations of ageing — loss of muscle mass, rising blood pressure and diminished nervous system function — are because the body’s ability to metabolise magnesium may decrease with age. Dr Ferguson uses magnesium to treat migraines as it has a relaxing and calming effect on the body. A German study found a 41.6 per cent drop in migraine frequency among sufferers who were given a supplement, and it can also treat asthma by suppressing histamine production. But many medications can cause a magnesium deficiency, as Mary Wood discovered. The 60-year-old retired consultant from Warwick suffered from acid reflux for years, controlling it with over-the-counter remedies. But when her discomfort worsened, her GP prescribed omeprazole tablets, a type of medicine known as a proton-pump inhibitor, which have been found to inhibit magnesium absorption when used long-term. Although they eased the heartburn, after 18 months she had an unusual side-effect. ‘I had a strange sensation down my left side,’ says Mary. ‘Over months, it developed from a kind of fluttering into a spasm, as if an unborn baby was kicking me.’ Mary’s GP was baffled. ‘All his tests were inconclusive, which worried me even more,’ she says. ‘All sorts of horrible illnesses came into my mind, including cancer.’ Her husband, John, did some internet research and within 15 minutes he had found a cause. ‘He told me lots of people were complaining on forums of the same symptoms and that they turned out to have magnesium deficiency,’ says Mary. ‘He told me beetroot contains magnesium, and we had a ready supply on the allotment. ‘We started eating it in salads, soups, everything. Within a couple of days, the pain stopped, just like that.’ Mary told her GP about her self-diagnosis and treatment. ‘He said he’d just been reading new research about magnesium deficiency, so clearly doctors are catching on to it at last,’ she says. ‘I had no idea just how vital it was to our bodies. It’s incredible to think I lived with these symptoms for so long and yet the remedy was so simple.’ In fact, digestive conditions such as acid reflux are often related to magnesium deficiency, and medications can make the problem even worse. Mary’s GP switched her to another indigestion remedy, Ranitidine, and the discomfort never recurred. But when her heartburn worsened a year ago and the doctor prescribed a stronger medication called Esomeprazole, Mary added a magnesium supplement to her diet, as well as upping her intake of beetroot and other magnesium-rich food. ‘It is common for people suffering from digestive problems to have a magnesium deficiency,’ says Dr Ferguson. ‘If your digestive system isn’t working properly, the acids in your stomach will not break down food, preventing the absorption of vital nutrients.’ For Ahlem, help came in the form of an intravenous vitamin cocktail, including magnesium, prescribed by Dr Talib. ‘Within days, I could feel a significant improvement as my symptoms started to fade away and became more manageable,’ she says. ‘I began eating magnesium-rich foods, such as pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds and avocados. ‘Dr Talib also explained that I needed supplements to support my adrenal gland because poor adrenal function encourages the body to expel high levels of magnesium as waste. ‘No one ever talks about magnesium, so I had no idea I needed it in my diet — let alone that being deficient could have such a dramatic impact on my life.’ thefoodpsychologist.com . healthydoc.com ."

"By . Paul Donnelley . Three thugs high on drink and drugs have been jailed after robbing two men in Salford within minutes of each other. Ballet master Dominic Antonucci, 39, was walking through Ordsall Park at 11am on Saturday, February 1 ahead of a matinee performance of The Prince of the Pagodas at the Lowry Theatre when he was attacked Manchester Crown Court heard. Mr Antonucci, who dances with Birmingham Royal Ballet, was pulling his suitcase and wearing a rucksack when he was set upon by William Paine, 23, Liam Johnson, 18, and Jerome Tue, 18. Liam Johnson (centre with thumbs up) arrives at Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for two years for two muggings . Mr Antonucci was punched in the face and had a bottle smashed over his head before going to the ground where he was kicked and punched. He cried out for help and passers-by came over as the three thugs walked away in a ‘casual manner’ with his suitcase. It was later found dumped. Mr Antonucci was taken to Salford Royal where he was treated but still suffers from a serious injury to his left eye. In a victim impact statement read to the court Mr Antonucci said he is still having problems with his eye and had been unable to work for two months after the robbery. However, he said that bore no ill-will towards his attackers. Mr Antonucci a father of one who was bullied at school because of his love of ballet, suffered serious neck and head injuries as well as damaged teeth and he needed surgery to repair a damaged retina in his left eye. He later had to wear an eye patch and was unable to perform for eight weeks and now feels nervous whenever he goes out. Victim: Dominic Antonucci (laying down in front) was unable to work for eight weeks after the attack on him in a Salford park . In a statement he said: ‘As someone who has worked in pretty rough schools teaching dance I feel for them and I hope they can get themselves sorted out. I don’t have any feelings of revenge. ‘I’m just pleased there’s no lasting effects and I’m back at work. It was a sickening attack and I’m thrilled it’s all over. It saved a lot of trouble and heartache for everyone that they all pleaded guilty. That was a big comfort. ‘Everything happened so fast so it’s really lucky there were witnesses. It was half way over before I knew what was going on so I would not have been much of a help. My daughter is 15 and she was very upset to see my injuries and what happened. William Paine (looking at camera) outside Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for two years . William Paine (left) shows respect for the law by turning up in a grey tracksuit at Manchester Crown Court where he was jailed for two years for a vicious mugging . ‘We’re just relieved it’s over and we can move on with our lives. It was a traumatic experience. It has taken me a long time to feel comfortable on the streets again. I was a bit afraid of even a pigeon flying nearby. It does feel like I can close the book on it. ‘It was the frustration at having to see them unzip my suitcase and go through it. My front teeth were badly damaged and I am still receiving treatment with an estimated cost of £900. ‘I have a scratch to the left cornea which has meant five different hospital visits. That’s had the most impact on my daily life as I have been unable to work for 7 to 8 weeks and had to wear an eye patch and dark glasses. Even now I’m quite nervous when out and it’s difficult because I’m usually a confident guy.’ Within minutes the three muggers had struck again, this time attacking John Owen, 52, a postman on his delivery round. One of the three shouted: ‘Let’s do him. lads!’ and he was then subjected to a ‘frenzied’ attack, being kicked and punched while curled up in a ball before his attackers left with his postbag. Mr Owen, a postman for 11 years, has felt unable to go out on rounds again following the attack, suffers anxiety attacks and his victim impact statement said that the robbery had a ‘massive effect’ on his personality. ‘[They] don’t realise the after effect these incidents have on people,’ he told the court. Police were called and all three were arrested after fleeing the scene of the attack. Paine, Johnson and Tue all from Salford admitted two counts of robbery at an earlier hearing. Paine, a father-of-two, had numerous previous convictions, as did Johnson, including a conviction aged 13 for a robbery involving a knife. Tue had never been in trouble before. The court heard all three had been drinking and taking cocaine at an all-night party and could remember little if anything of the robberies. Ordsall Park where Mr Antonucci was attacked . Jailing Paine and Johnson, Recorder Terence Rigby told them: ‘This is not just a tragedy for you but a tragedy for your family and friends and it is one you have brought upon them. My judgement is that each of these offences was very if not the most serious of robberies - made the more serious by the fact there were two robberies on two victims within a few minutes of each other. ‘I have no doubt drink and drugs played a part in what you did but the fact of the matter is it doesn’t matter to him whether you were drunk or had been taking cocaine or anything else. ‘What matters to him is that he was set upon and violently assaulted. I think that this is not a tragedy for you but it is a tragedy for your family and friends and one that you have brought on them and I hope you all finally see sense.’ Defending father-of-two Paine, Hunter Gray said: ‘He has not drunk alcohol since the offences. No real forethought went into this.’ For Johnson, Robert Kearney: ‘His memory of the incident is non-existent. It was a brave thing to enter his plea. A guilty plea is the ultimate expression of remorse. He has GCSEs and has qualified in football coaching. It lacked sophistication. A hooded top is the uniform of youth not a form of disguise.’ Paine and Jones were each jailed for two years and Tue got 16 months. All were told pay a £100 victim surcharge."

"One post about an alleged child abduction on a mothers' group on Facebook has spawned widespread panic across Sydney's Northern Beaches. A member of Northern Beaches Mums' Group claims she saw a young girl - aged five or six years old - being taken from a bus shelter near Pittwater Golf Centre on Pittwater Road in Warriewood on Wednesday night. She posted her sighting on the page, saying it happened about 10.30pm. A concerned citizen posted on a mothers' group on Facebook, saying she had witnessed a child abduction . Urging people to be on the look out for anyone suspicious, the woman said the alleged offender was a man about 177cm tall who had dark hair, a moustache and was wearing black pants and a tracksuit top. The incident was reported to police who followed it up but did not find anything to substantiate the claims. But the post caused great alarm among the 6,000-plus members, with some driving through the streets in the Sydney suburb searching for the girl. Less than an hour after the alert went out, the post had amassed more than 340 comments, Manly Daily reported. The post caused widespread alarm but police have investigated the incident and saw there was no evidence to suggest it happened . Page founder Annika Coulson urged members not to post alleged crimes on social media but instead contact the police to ensure it was dealt with properly by the authorities. 'If you see a crime or something disturbing your first port of call is the police not Facebook,' Ms Coulson told News Corp. Northern beaches Local Area Command Acting Inspector Rob Winkler confirmed police had investigated the matter. '[We] have not found any information to suggest there was an abduction,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'We would always urge people if they have witnessed a crime to contact police immediately.' Insp Winkler said police have asked the administrator to remove the post as it was causing concern among the mothers group. Police have also said they had received phone calls from concerned citizens wanting to be updated on the situation."
"By . Kate Lyons . A woman whose four guinea pigs were brutally murdered believes the attack might be the latest attack from a 'serial pet killer'. Amanda Milligan returned to her Cairns home at 10.30pm on Friday to find the bodies of four of her guinea pigs on the driveway. One had had its throat slit, the other had its chest cut open and two others appeared to have suffered blunt force trauma, she believes from being bashed against the driveway. Amanda Milligan - pictured here with her five-year-old daughter, Candice - returned to her Cairns home to find four of her guinea pigs slaughtered . Two of the guinea pigs, Miss Aurora and Temprance, were Ms Milligan's pets and two Angel and Maisy were rescue guinea pigs. Maisy, was heavily pregnant with twins. 'I was gutted. I can't comprehend why,' she told MailOnline. Ms Milligan runs the Guinea Pig Haven Rescue Shelter and is known in the area as someone who takes in unwanted or injured guinea pigs. The incident happened on Friday and Ms Milligan believes it may the latest attack by a 'serial pet killer' She believes the assailants came in through the front gate, were confronted by her two dogs, which were then locked in the garage, before proceeding to the front of the house where the guinea pigs were kept in a table-top cage. 'We don't know if they were originally trying to break in or if the guinea pigs were the sole intent of the mission,' she said. Ms Milligan said one of her dogs and her cat were harmed in the incident and her cat is now terrified to go into the front yard. She is worried that the attacks might be the work of a serial pet killer. 'I believe there was another dog killed a couple of nights after the [guinea] pigs were killed. Someone is taking pot shots at large birds, not killing them, maiming them. It seems a little too much of a coincidence that it's been happening in the same area,' she said. Ms Milligan (left) said the attack - that left one pig with its throat slit, another with its chest cut open and two others with blunt force trauma - had 'traumatised' her children, including Candice (right) Ms Milligan, who has nine other guinea pigs, said she is worried that the assailants might return for the rest of the animals, or worse, her children. 'I have two young children, a five-year-old and a two-year-old, I'm concerned that once [the attackers] get bored of killing animals they'll go to another target – children or the elderly,' she said. Ms Milligan said the attack had 'traumatised' her two children, aged two and five. Her older daughter asked her mother if the guinea pigs had 'gone to be with grandpa', Ms Milligan's father, who passed away less than a year ago. 'It's still heartbreaking trying to explain to her that they're not coming back and that they're with grandpa now and he'll look after them,' she said. Clockwise from top left: Maisy, Angel, Temprance and Miss Aurora were all killed in the attack on Friday night . Police are investigating the incident and they are today conducting autopsies on the guinea pigs to establish the cause of death. Senior Constable Andrew Abraham described the incident as a 'very disturbed attack' and said police were looking into whether this incident might be linked to any other crimes in the area. Ms Milligan has offered a $500 reward, raised from the donations of supporters, to anyone with information about the crime. 'We need someone to pay for what they've done,' she said. Posters have been put up around the area of the attack in the hope that people might come forward with information ."
"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Conflict raged Wednesday in volatile northwestern Pakistan, with nine militants killed in a gun battle, the Taliban's abduction and release of about 30 police officers, and strikes on stranded NATO trucks. Pakistani policemen at a check point in Khyber Agency near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, February 12, 2008. It's the latest fighting between Pakistani security forces and the Taliban militants in the northwestern region near Afghanistan. The country's central government has little control in the area, and U.S. intelligence officials say the area is a haven for militants. Nine militants were killed when police and local residents foiled an attempted kidnapping of the mayor in a village on the outskirts of Peshawar, police told CNN. Taliban fighters attempted to abduct Fahim Ur Rehman, but police and residents resisted and a gun battle ensued. Along with the slain militants, two police and two civilians were wounded and some of the militants fled. The village, Bazid Khel, is located between Peshawar and the Khyber Agency in the tribal areas. In the Swat Valley, militants abducted around 30 police Tuesday night but eventually released them on Wednesday. Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan confirmed to CNN that the personnel had been released after returning to the path of Islam and promising not to return to their jobs. Police told CNN that the security personnel had been forced to agree to the Taliban's terms and confirmed the release. There are conflicting details about the incident, in which Taliban forces attacked the Shamozai check post in the Barikot area of Swat Valley on Tuesday night and captured the people after a nightlong firefight. Khan said the personnel surrendered after Taliban forces mined the area, preventing access. He said their ammunition was seized when supply vehicles coming to assist government forces were stopped by Taliban mines. Pakistan police said the security personnel didn't surrender; they were caught after they used up their ammunition. Police and military sources said the personnel were police, but Khan said paramilitary officers as well as police were among the group. Locals said government forces came under attack Tuesday evening and ran out of ammunition before surrendering. This comes as the Pakistani military beefed up its operations this week in the Swat Valley. In the latest in a series of recent attacks meant to choke off supplies into Afghanistan for the United States and its allies, a rocket strike destroyed at least nine vehicles near the town Landi Kotal in the Khyber Agency -- one of seven semiautonomous tribal agencies along the Afghan border, a Khyber official told CNN. The trucks were returning from Afghanistan but were stranded in the town because, a day earlier, suspected militants had destroyed a bridge connecting Landi Kotal to Jamrod, another part of the Khyber Agency. The bridge's destruction had forced authorities to halt traffic. Because Afghanistan is landlocked, many of the supplies for NATO-led troops fighting Islamic militants there have to be trucked from Pakistan. In recent months, militants aligned with the Taliban and al Qaeda have carried out several attacks to disrupt supplies, Pakistani officials said."
